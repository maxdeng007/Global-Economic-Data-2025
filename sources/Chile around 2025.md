# Chile around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Chile “turn”**, in the same style as your other country profiles:  
**wages → household incomes & inequality → GDP & GDP per head → how they line up, plus practical benchmarks.**

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Chile (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage – the middle of the distribution

INE’s **Encuesta Suplementaria de Ingresos (ESI) 2024** gives the clearest picture of what workers actually receive:

- **Median labour income (net, all occupied persons, 2024):**  
  **CLP 611,162/month** (this is explicitly “net monthly income – corresponding to gross income minus mandatory deductions”) [1].  

Chile’s tax wedge on labour is very low by OECD standards (≈ **2.7 %** for a typical worker) [13]. Converting net to a **gross‑type benchmark**:

- **Estimated median gross monthly wage:**  
  ≈ **CLP 630,000/month** (≈ **US\$660/month** at ≈ **CLP 950 ≈ US\$1**)  

Using a typical full‑time workload (~165 hours/month):

- **Median gross hourly wage:**  
  ≈ **CLP 3,800/hour** → **≈ US\$4/hour**.

Interpretation:

> A **“typical” full‑time worker in Chile** is around **CLP 600–650k/month net (≈ US\$640–680)**, or **CLP ~630k gross**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages – pulled up by higher earners

The same INE release reports:

- **Average labour income (net, 2024):** **CLP 897,019/month** [1][6].  

Correcting by the low tax wedge:

- **Estimated average gross monthly wage:**  
  ≈ **CLP 923,000/month** (≈ **US\$970/month**).

Side‑by‑side:

| Indicator (2024–25) | CLP/month | Approx. US\$/month* |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Median labour income (net)** | 611,162 | ≈ 643 |
| **Median wage (gross, est.)** | ≈ 630,000 | ≈ 660 |
| **Average labour income (net)** | 897,019 | ≈ 944 |
| **Average wage (gross, est.)** | ≈ 923,000 | ≈ 970 |

\*Using ≈ CLP 950 = US\$1 (2025 average) [14].

The **mean is ~46 % above the median** (923k vs 630k), showing a **strong upper tail** of high earners in mining, finance, IT and senior management.

### 1.3 Minimum wage – the statutory floor

Recent reforms significantly raised Chile’s minimum wage:

- **From January 2025 (Monthly Minimum Income, MMI):**  
  – **CLP 510,636/month** [10].  
- **From 1 May 2025:**  
  – **Statutory minimum wage for ages 18–65:** **CLP 529,000/month** (≈ **US\$557/month**) [10][3][6].  

Rough net figure (low tax wedge):

- **Minimum net wage:** ≈ **CLP 515k/month** (≈ **US\$540**).

Relative to central benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median gross wage:**  
  – 529k / 630k ≈ **84 %**.  
- **Minimum vs average gross wage:**  
  – 529k / 923k ≈ **57 %**.

So a full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns **just under the “typical” worker’s level**, but still **far below higher‑paid professional jobs**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

INE’s ESI 2024 press note provides male/female incomes [1]:

- **Men (net, 2024):**  
  – Average: **CLP 1,001,510**, Median: **CLP 698,255**.  
- **Women (net, 2024):**  
  – Average: **CLP 756,715**, Median: **CLP 555,362**.

Calculated gaps:

- **Mean gender pay gap:**  
  – Women’s average / men’s average ≈ 756,715 / 1,001,510 ≈ **0.755** → **24–25 % gap**.  
- **Median gender pay gap:**  
  – 555,362 / 698,255 ≈ **0.795** → **≈ 20 % gap**.

Consistent academic and policy work rounds this to **≈ 24.4 %** in favour of men [4][1].

> Women in Chile earn about **24 % less than men on average**, and **≈ 20 % less at the median**, even before adjusting for occupation, hours or seniority.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage contrasts

From INE ESI 2024 and specialised salary surveys [1][10][11][12]:

**By category (net monthly income, 2024):**

- **Employer / business owner:**  
  – **CLP 1,447,788** (≈ **US\$1,524**).  
- **Employees:**  
  – **Public sector:** **CLP 1,227,669** (≈ **US\$1,292**).  
  – **Private sector:** **CLP 957,609** (≈ **US\$1,008**).  
- **Self‑employed (cuenta propia):**  
  – **CLP 491,175** (≈ **US\$517**).

**By sector/profession (approx. gross monthly, 2025 surveys):**

- **IT & Software – IT consultant:**  
  – **≈ CLP 45.6m/year** → **≈ CLP 3.8m/month** (≈ **US\$4,000/month**) [10].  
- **Finance – financial analyst (Santiago):**  
  – **≈ CLP 32.1m/year** → **≈ CLP 2.7m/month** (≈ **US\$2,800/month**) [11].  
- **Secondary school teacher:**  
  – **≈ CLP 20.8m/year** → **≈ CLP 1.7m/month** (≈ **US\$1,800/month**) [12].

**Regional medians (net, 2024) [1]:**

- **Región Metropolitana (Santiago):**  
  – Median: **CLP 702,463**.  
- **Región de Magallanes:** **CLP 795,579**.  
- **Región de Antofagasta:** **CLP 757,312**.

These regional medians sit **15–30 % above the national median (611k)**, reflecting mining and high‑cost southern economies.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income

From ESI 2024 and census‑based household‑size data [1][15]:

- **Median per‑capita labour income (net, 2024):**  
  – **CLP 611,162/month** (≈ **US\$643**).  

Average household size for Chile is about **3.0 persons** [15]:

- **Median household disposable labour income:**  
  – 611,162 × 3 ≈ **CLP 1,833,000/month** (≈ **US\$1,930/month**).  

Using the mean:

- **Average per‑capita labour income:**  
  – 897,019 CLP (net) → **CLP 897,019/month** (≈ **US\$944**).  
- **Average household labour income (3 persons):**  
  – ≈ **CLP 2,690,000/month** (≈ **US\$2,830/month**).

In practice:

> A **“typical” Chilean household of 3 people** lives on about **CLP 1.8–2.7m/month net** (≈ **US\$1,900–2,800**), depending on whether we look at the median or the average.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

The **CASEN 2024** survey (new methodology) indicates:

- **Gini coefficient (monetary income):** **≈ 0.46** (i.e. **46 %**) [7][2][6].  

Other decomposition work notes:

- **Gini for autonomous income** higher (~0.49),  
- **Gini for “monetary income” (autonomous + transfers)** around **0.46** [6].

Interpretation:

- Chile remains a **high‑inequality country** by OECD standards (where many countries sit near 0.30), but has shown a **gradual reduction** from peaks near or above 0.50 in earlier decades.

### 2.3 Poverty – levels and thresholds

With **median per‑capita income of CLP 611,162**, a standard 60 % relative line yields:

- **Poverty line (per person, monthly):**  
  – 0.6 × 611,162 ≈ **CLP 366,700** → **≈ US\$386/month**.  

CASEN 2024 (new, stricter methodology) reports [2][9]:

- **Income‑poverty rate (headcount):** **17.3 %** (down from 20.5 % in 2022).  
- **Extreme income poverty:** **6.9 %** (down from 8.5 %).  
- **Multidimensional poverty (new definition):** **17.7 %** of the population.  

Thus:

> Roughly **one in six Chileans** is **income‑poor**, and **about one in five** faces **multidimensional poverty**, even though national averages have improved.

---

## 3. Chile’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person

IMF/Worldometer for 2025 [4][19]:

- **Total nominal GDP, 2025:** ≈ **US\$363 billion**.  
- **Population, 2025:** ≈ **19.86 million**.  

Hence:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **US\$17,181**.

### 3.2 PPP GDP per capita

IMF/Statista PPP series for Chile [5][18]:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025 (estimate):** **≈ US\$30,260**.

So:

> Chile produces about **US\$17k of output per person at market exchange rates**, and **~US\$30k per person** after adjusting for lower domestic prices (PPP).

### 3.3 Real GDP growth

OECD Economic Outlook (Dec 2025) and Chilean authorities:

- **Real GDP growth, 2024:** ≈ **2.4 %** [7].  
- **Real GDP growth, 2025 (projection in late 2025):** **2.4 %** [7][16].  
  – The Central Bank’s December 2025 Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) gives a similar central scenario [3].

### 3.4 Inflation

Central Bank of Chile, December 2025 IPoM summary [3]:

- **Annual CPI inflation (total), November 2025:** **3.4 %**.  
- **Core CPI inflation:** **3.4 %**.  
- Projection: inflation to reach the **3 % target** during **early 2026**.

So 2025 is an environment of **near‑target, disinflating inflation**.

### 3.5 Labour market

National Employment Survey (INE) and TradingEconomics [8]:

- **Unemployment rate (Aug–Oct 2025 quarter):** **8.4 %** (non‑seasonally adjusted).  
- **Seasonally adjusted:** **≈ 8.6 %** (Sep–Nov 2025).  

Thus Chile faces:

> **Elevated but not extreme unemployment (~8–9 %)**, with higher rates among **youth** and in **low‑skill occupations**, despite overall positive growth.

## 4. GDP vs Wages vs Incomes – How They Line Up

### 4.1 Key metrics together

| Metric (Chile ≈2025) | Approximate value |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per person** | **US\$17,181/year** |
| **PPP GDP per person** | **≈ US\$30,260/year** |
| **Median gross wage (worker)** | **≈ CLP 630k/month ≈ US\$660 (≈ US\$7,900/year)** |
| **Average gross wage (worker)** | **≈ CLP 923k/month ≈ US\$970 (≈ US\$11,600/year)** |
| **Minimum wage (May 2025)** | **CLP 529k/month ≈ US\$557** |
| **Median per‑capita net income** | **≈ CLP 611k/month ≈ US\$643 (≈ US\$7,700/year)** |
| **Median household net income (3 people)** | **≈ CLP 1.83m/month ≈ US\$1,930** |
| **Poverty line (per person, 60 % median)** | **≈ CLP 367k/month ≈ US\$386** |
| **Income‑poverty rate** | **≈ 17.3 %** |
| **Extreme poverty** | **≈ 6.9 %** |
| **Multidimensional poverty** | **≈ 17.7 %** |
| **Gini (monetary income)** | **≈ 0.46** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 8.4–8.6 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 3.4 %** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 2.4 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs typical personal incomes**  
   - **GDP/head (US\$17.2k)** notably exceeds the **typical worker’s annual earnings (~US\$8–11.6k)** and the **median person’s net income (~US\$7.7k)**.  
   - The difference reflects:
     - **Corporate profits (especially in mining and services)**,  
     - **Taxes and social contributions**,  
     - **Public spending and investment**,  
     - GDP being averaged across **children, retirees, and non‑workers**, not just wage earners.

2. **Mean vs median wages**  
   - The **average wage (~CLP 923k)** is about **46 % higher** than the **median (~CLP 630k)**, so using the mean as “what people earn” **overstates** typical earnings.  
   - High‑pay sectors (mining, IT, finance, senior management) **pull the average up**, even though the majority of workers sit around CLP 500–800k/month net.

3. **Wages, households and poverty**  
   - A **single median earner** (≈ CLP 630k gross, ≈ CLP 610k net) supporting a **3‑person household** will sit **close to the national poverty threshold** (3 × CLP ≈ 367k = ≈ CLP 1.1m).  
   - **Dual‑earner households** or those with one higher‑paid professional are more securely in the **CLP 1.5–2.5m/month** middle‑income bracket.  
   - The fact that **17.3 %** of people are income‑poor despite relatively high GDP/head shows that **growth and resource rents are not fully translating into broad‑based household incomes**.

4. **Inequality and exclusion**  
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.46**, Chile is **more equal than some Latin‑American neighbours** but **more unequal than almost every OECD country**.  
   - Transfers and minimum‑wage policies mitigate inequality but do not eliminate:
     - **Highly paid elites** (mining, finance, tech),  
     - **Large low‑wage segments** in services, informal work and rural areas.

5. **Macro environment and real incomes**  
   - **Real GDP growth ~2.4 %** and **inflation ~3.4 %** combined with **nominal wage growth ~6 %** (IR index +5.9 % YoY in Nov 2025 [2]) suggest **small real wage gains on average**.  
   - However, **rising housing, energy and services costs**, especially in Santiago, often absorb much of those gains for **lower‑ and lower‑middle‑income households**.

---

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Chile, ≈2025)

### 5.1 Individual worker – gross monthly income (CLP)

Approximate **national positioning**:

- **< CLP 500,000/month**  
  – **Low income or near‑poverty**, especially if full‑time; common in informal jobs, some retail/hospitality, basic services.

- **CLP 500,000 – 700,000/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle tier**, clustering around the **median**; typical for many clerical, junior public‑sector and service roles.

- **CLP 700,000 – 1,000,000/month**  
  – **Core middle‑income range**; experienced teachers, nurses, mid‑level office staff, some technicians.

- **CLP 1,000,000 – 1,500,000/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle**; many professionals in engineering, finance, IT, senior administrators.

- **> CLP 1,500,000/month**  
  – **High income** nationally; senior management, top professionals, and high‑pay corporate/expat roles.

### 5.2 Households – net monthly income (≈ 3‑person household)

Using the **median ≈ CLP 1.83m/month** as a reference:

- **< CLP 1,100,000/month**  
  – Often **at or below the poverty line**; heavy reliance on transfers, tight budgets even outside Santiago.

- **CLP 1,100,000 – 1,800,000/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle**; essentials covered, but vulnerable to shocks; housing costs and debt can be heavy.

- **CLP 1,800,000 – 2,500,000/month**  
  – **Broad middle class**; can manage rent/mortgage, schooling and modest savings, especially outside prime urban zones.

- **> CLP 2,500,000/month**  
  – **Comfortable to affluent**; ability to save, invest, and withstand economic shocks, particularly outside the most expensive Santiago districts.

## 6. Short “Chile 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Chile** is an **upper‑middle‑income, high‑GDP per capita economy** with **nominal output per head about US\$17,200** and **PPP GDP per head about US\$30,300**. A **typical worker** earns roughly **CLP 630k/month gross** (≈ **US\$660**), while the **average wage** is higher at **≈ CLP 923k/month** (≈ **US\$970**). The **statutory minimum wage** reached **CLP 529k/month** in May 2025, roughly **84 % of the median wage**, reflecting a relatively compressed lower end of the wage distribution.  

After taxes and transfers, the **median person** lives on about **CLP 611k/month** (≈ **US\$640**), and a **typical 3‑person household** has around **CLP 1.8–2.7m/month** (≈ **US\$1,900–2,800**). Yet **income poverty still affects ≈ 17 % of the population**, **extreme poverty ≈ 7 %**, and **multidimensional poverty ≈ 18 %**, in a context of **persistent inequality (Gini ≈ 0.46)** and **elevated unemployment (~8–9 %)**.  

Macroeconomically, Chile combines **moderate real GDP growth (~2.4 %)**, **near‑target inflation (~3.4 %)** and **rising real wages**, but **large sectoral and regional disparities**, a **gender pay gap of ~20–24 %**, and **high living costs for low‑income households** mean that the country’s strong aggregate GDP figures still feel distant from the everyday reality of many Chilean families.
