# Canada around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is a Canada‑focused report in the same style as your earlier “turns” (UK, China, Japan, Germany, France, USA, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Austria).

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Canada (2024–2025)

### 1.1 “Typical” (median‑type) earnings

Statistics Canada’s income tables give a **median total income for individuals (excluding zeros)**:

- **Median total income, individuals 15+ (2023)**: **\$45,400** (2023 constant CAD) [1].

This is **all income**, not just wages, but for most working‑age people it is dominated by employment income. With modest nominal growth since 2023, a reasonable **2025‑era median individual gross income** is:

- **≈ \$47,000 per year** (rough order of magnitude).

Using a standard full‑time schedule (~2,080 hours/year):

- **Implied median hourly earnings** ≈ \$47,000 ÷ 2,080 ≈ **\$22–23 per hour**.

Because this median covers all individuals (not only full‑time workers), a **typical full‑time employee’s wage** will be moderately higher, roughly in the **high \$50k–low \$60k** range before tax.

You can think in simple benchmarks:

- **Median‑type full‑time gross salary (all industries)**: **≈ \$58k–\$62k per year** (approximation based on individual‑income medians and tax rates).

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Several official earnings indicators show what the **average worker** earns.

**Average weekly earnings (non‑farm payroll employees)**:

- **Canada, Sept 2024**: **\$1,280.28 per week** (including overtime) [3].
  → Annualized:
  \[
  1{,}280.28 \times 52 \approx \$66{,}600\ \text{per year}
  \]

**Average hourly wage (all employees, main job)**:

- **2024 average hourly wage**: **\$35.20 / hour** (2024 constant dollars) [4].
  If someone works 40 hours/week, 52 weeks/year:
  \[
  35.20 \times 40 \times 52 \approx \$73{,}200\ \text{per year}
  \]

Both series point to:

- **Mean earnings (all employees)**: **≈ \$66k–\$73k per year**, higher than the median because of high earners at the top.

### 1.3 Gender wage gap

From Statistics Canada’s quality‑of‑life “Wages” and “Average earnings” indicators:

- **Average hourly wage, 2024 (current \$)**:
  - Men: **\$37.50 / hour**
  - Women: **\$32.77 / hour** [4][5]

Women therefore earn, on average, about:

- **12.6 % less per hour than men** (women earn ~\$0.87 for every dollar men earn).

The gap is smaller for young workers and larger for older/high‑educated groups, but **overall gender wage inequality remains material**.

### 1.4 Sector differences (high vs low pay)

Using compiled industry‑level averages for 2025 [6]:

| Sector (Canada, ≈2025) | Average hourly wage (CAD) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Utilities | **\$55.72** |
| Mining, quarrying, oil & gas | **\$51.24** |
| Professional, scientific & technical services | **\$47.14** |
| Public administration | **\$46.14** |
| Finance, insurance, real estate, rental & leasing | **\$43.75** |
| Educational services | **\$41.74** |
| Construction | **\$38.53** |
| Manufacturing | **\$34.98** |
| Wholesale & retail trade | **\$27.15** |
| Accommodation & food services | **\$20.88** |

Broadly:

- **Top‑paying sectors**: **utilities, resource extraction, professional services, public administration, finance**.
- **Lower‑pay sectors**: **retail, hospitality, some personal services**.

### 1.5 Minimum wage

Canada does **not** have one unified national minimum wage; it has:

- **Federal minimum wage** (for federally‑regulated workers):
  - **\$17.75 per hour from April 1, 2025** [7].
- Each province/territory sets its own minimum; most fall in roughly **\$14–\$17 per hour** by 2025.

A full‑time worker on **\$17.75/hour** at 40 hours/week earns about:

- ≈ **\$36,900 per year** (before tax).

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median after‑tax income – what people actually live on

The **Canadian Income Survey** provides the best snapshot of household resources after tax.

**Economic families + persons not in an economic family (Canada, 2023)**:

- **Median after‑tax income**: **\$74,200 per year** (2023 constant dollars) [2].
- This is for the **whole family/household unit**, not per person.

Statistics Canada’s table on individual incomes shows for 2023 [8]:

- **Median after‑tax income per individual** (all persons): **\$39,900 per year**.

Average household size is about **2.4–2.5 persons** (WorldPopulationReview and StatCan household estimates) [9][19]. If we divide the **median household after‑tax income** by **2.45 persons**, we get a rough **median per‑person share within the median household**:

\[
74{,}200 \div 2.45 \approx 30{,}300\ \text{per person per year (after tax)}
\]

You can think of it this way:

- **Typical household (2–3 people)**:
  – **≈ \$74k after tax per year**.
- **Typical person inside that household**:
  – **≈ \$30k per year** as their “share” of resources.
- **Median individual after‑tax income** (all people) is higher (~\$39.9k) because it treats each person’s own income, not equivalised household shares.

### 2.2 Average (mean) disposable income

From a Statistics Canada quintile breakdown of **disposable income by income quintile** [9][3]:

- **Average disposable income per household, 2024**: **\$100,702** (up from \$95,471 in 2023).

This is an **average, not a median**, so it is pulled up by high‑income households. Compared with the median of \$74,200:

- The **mean is ≈36 % higher** than the median, indicating a **right‑skewed income distribution**.

A cross‑country PPP comparison (OECD data, compiled on Wikipedia) gives:

- **Canada – gross household disposable income per capita (PPP)**: **US \$47,737** [4].

This PPP value means the **average Canadian** has after‑tax income equivalent to **about \$48k international dollars per year**, after adjusting for Canadian prices.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Statistics Canada’s table on Gini coefficients for adjusted income [10]:

- **Gini, adjusted after‑tax income (Canada)**:
  - 2019: 0.299
  - 2022: 0.300
  - 2023: **0.300**

So by 2023–24:

- **Canada’s income inequality** sits at **Gini ≈ 0.30**.

Interpretation:

- **Less unequal** than the US (~0.48–0.49),
- Similar to or slightly more equal than many Western European countries (France, Germany ~0.29–0.30),
- **More unequal** than the very egalitarian Nordic countries (Gini ~0.26–0.28).

### 2.4 Poverty (Canada’s Official Poverty Line)

Canada uses the **Market Basket Measure (MBM)** as its **Official Poverty Line**.

Latest provisional estimates [9]:

- **2024 national poverty rate**: **10.9 %** of the population.
  – Unchanged from the official 2023 rate.

This means roughly **1 in 9 Canadians** is living below the MBM‑based poverty line, despite Canada being a very high‑income country.

Other indicators from the Official Poverty Dashboard [9][2]:

- **Deep income poverty** (below 75 % of the official poverty line):
  - **5.0 %** of people in 2022.
- **Child poverty**:
  - Preliminary modelling suggests **around 11 %** of children were in poverty in 2023 [11].

Poverty is **higher among**:

- Children and lone‑parent households,
- Some racialised and Indigenous populations,
- Certain regions (e.g., parts of Atlantic Canada and some northern/rural areas).

## 3. Canada’s GDP – Size, Growth, and GDP per Person

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

IMF‑based figures compiled by Worldometer [12][13]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **US \$2.2836 trillion**.
- **Population, mid‑2025**: **40,126,723** people.

Using the 2025 average exchange rate **1 CAD ≈ 0.71565 USD** [exchange rate data], this implies:

- **Nominal GDP in CAD**:
  \[
  2.2836\ \text{trn USD} \div 0.71565 \approx 3.19\ \text{trn CAD}
  \]

### 3.2 GDP per person – nominal and PPP

From the “Economy of Canada” profile and Worldometer’s GDP per‑capita table [14][15][12][13]:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025**: **US \$54,935**.
  Converting at 1 CAD ≈ 0.71565 USD:

  \[
  \text{GDP per person in CAD} \approx 54{,}935 \div 0.71565 \approx 79{,}500\ \text{CAD per year}
  \]

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025**:
  - IMF/Wikipedia: **≈ US \$65,500** (PPP) [15].
  - WorldEconomics: **US \$63,931** PPP per person [15].
  → Converting with the same rate gives **≈ \$91k–92k CAD PPP per person**.

So, in simple terms:

- **Canada produces roughly \$80k CAD of output per person per year (market prices)**,
- And about **\$90k+ CAD per person when adjusted for purchasing power**.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth, 2025**:
  - Bank of Canada Monetary Policy Report (Oct 2025) projection: **1.2 %** real growth for 2025 [16].
  - Worldometer/IMF summary is consistent: GDP growth rate **≈ 1.2 %** in 2025 [12].

- **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation**:
  - **Year‑over‑year CPI in November 2025**: **2.2 %** [17].

Thus, for 2025:

- **Real growth is modest (~1–1.2 %)**,
- **Inflation is around 2.2 %**, near the Bank of Canada’s 2 % target.

### 3.4 Labour market

According to Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey (November 2025) and related commentary [18][19]:

- **Unemployment rate, Nov 2025**: **6.5 %** (down from 7.1 % in September).
- The unemployment rate **trended up through most of 2025**, peaking at **7.1 %** in September (highest since 2016), then easing to 6.5 % as job growth picked up.

So Canada in 2025 has:

- A **soft but not collapsing labour market**,
- **Higher unemployment than in the immediate pre‑COVID period**,
- Some ongoing slack, especially among young and lower‑skilled workers.

## 4. GDP vs Wages vs Household Incomes – How They Line Up

Putting the main numbers side by side:

| Metric (≈2025) | Value (CAD, annual) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **GDP per person (nominal)** | **≈ \$79,500** |
| **GDP per person (PPP, converted)** | **≈ \$91,500** |
| **Average employee earnings (weekly × 52)** | **≈ \$66,600** |
| **Median individual total income (2023)** | **\$45,400** (≈ \$47k in 2025) |
| **Median individual after‑tax income (2023)** | **\$39,900** |
| **Median household after‑tax income (2023)** | **\$74,200** |
| **Mean household disposable income (2024)** | **\$100,702** |
| **Official poverty rate (2024)** | **10.9 %** |
| **Gini (after‑tax income, 2023)** | **0.300** |

**Key relationships:**

1. **GDP per person (\~\$79.5k)** is **much higher** than:
   - The **median individual’s after‑tax income** (~\$40k), or
   - The **per‑person share in the median household** (~\$30k).

2. Roughly **half of GDP per capita** shows up as **after‑tax disposable income for the typical person**, with the rest absorbed by:
   - Corporate profits and investment,
   - Taxes and social contributions,
   - Public consumption and capital spending,
   - Depreciation and other non‑household uses.

3. **Inequality (Gini ≈ 0.30)** and a **sizeable low‑income segment (~11 % below the poverty line)** mean:
   - A smaller group at the top captures a disproportionately large share of income and wealth,
   - Many households live well below means and averages suggested by GDP.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (How to Use These Numbers)

### 5.1 For an individual worker (gross pay, per year)

In **Canadian dollars, per year, 2025‑style**:

- **< \$40,000**
  → Likely **below the national median** for working‑age individuals; common for part‑time or lower‑paid full‑time roles.

- **\$40,000–\$60,000**
  → **Around the general median** individual income bracket.
  Many clerical, early‑career professional, and skilled trade jobs sit here.

- **\$60,000–\$80,000**
  → **Middle to upper‑middle** for full‑time workers; typical for mid‑career professionals in cities.

- **> \$80,000**
  → **Upper decile territory** nationally, especially outside very high‑cost urban cores.

### 5.2 For a household (after‑tax income, per year)

- **< \$40,000**
  → Frequently **below or close to the Official Poverty Line** for multi‑person households.

- **\$50,000–\$80,000**
  → **Middle‑income range** for 2–3 person households; around the **median (\$74k)**.

- **>\$100,000**
  → **Above‑average living standard**, particularly outside the most expensive metro areas; represents the upper part of the distribution.

## 6. One‑Paragraph “Canada 2025” Summary

Around **2025**, **Canada** is a **very high‑income, moderately unequal economy** with a **nominal GDP of about US \$2.28 trillion (≈ \$3.19 trillion CAD)** and **GDP per person around US \$54,935 (≈ \$79,500 CAD)**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **\$58–62k CAD per year** before tax, while **average earnings** are higher at about **\$66k+ CAD per year**, reflecting top‑end earners. After taxes and transfers, the **median household** has about **\$74,200 CAD per year** to live on, and the **median individual** around **\$39,900 CAD**. Income inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.30)**, but about **10.9 %** of Canadians—roughly one in nine—still live **below the Official Poverty Line**, and around **5 %** are in **deep poverty**. Real GDP growth in 2025 is **modest (~1.2 %)**, inflation hovers around **2.2 %**, and the unemployment rate averages in the **6.5–7 %** range, leaving Canada as a **rich but somewhat unevenly shared economy**, with strong average output per person but clear gaps between the top and the lower‑income segments.
