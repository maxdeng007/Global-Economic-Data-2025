# Portugal around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Portugal “turn”**, in the same style as your other country profiles:
**wages → household incomes & inequality → GDP & GDP per head → how they line up, plus practical benchmarks.**

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Portugal (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage – the middle of the distribution

Several 2025 salary syntheses (Flatio, sector guides) converge on a **median‑type full‑time wage** around:

- **Median gross monthly wage, 2025:**
  **≈ €1,320/month**
  → **≈ €15,840/year** (14‑month systems will show somewhat higher annual totals) \[4\].

Using a typical full‑time workload (~165 hours/month):

- **Median gross hourly wage:**
  ≈ **€8/hour**.

Interpretation:

> A **“typical” full‑time worker** in Portugal earns **about €1.3k/month gross**.
> Half of workers earn less than this, half earn more.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages – pulled up by higher earners

INE data as reported in multiple 2025 overviews indicate:

- **Average gross monthly earnings per employee, 2025:** **€1,741** (up 6 % from €1,643 in June 2024) \[1\]\[2\].

Net pay (after tax and contributions) is lower:

- **Average net monthly wage, Q3 2025:** **€1,250** \[5\].

So, simplified:

| Indicator (≈2025) | Amount |
|-------------------|--------|
| Average gross monthly wage | **€1,741** |
| Average net monthly wage | **€1,250** |
| Median gross monthly wage (typical) | **≈ €1,320** |

The **mean gross wage is roughly 30 % above the median**, signalling a **sizeable upper tail** of higher‑paid workers (IT, finance, senior public sector, multinationals).

### 1.3 Minimum wage – the legal floor

For **2025**, the **statutory minimum wage** (mainland) is:

- **€870/month** gross, paid over **14 months**,
  → **€12,180/year** \[3\].
- If an employer distributes it over **12 months** instead, it is **≈ €1,015/month**, same annual total \[3\].

Regional variations:

- **Madeira:** €915/month
- **Azores:** €913.50/month \[3\].

Relative to other benchmarks:

- Minimum vs **median** wage: **~65–70 %**.
- Minimum vs **mean gross** wage: **~50 %**.

So a full‑time worker on the minimum wage is **well below the average** and still clearly **below a typical full‑time wage**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

There are several complementary indicators:

- **Official Eurostat‑style gap (2023):** **8.6 %** (men earn 8.6 % more per hour than women on average) \[8\].
- **Net monthly gap 2014–2024:**
  – 2014: Men €892, Women €751.
  – 2024: Men €1,311, Women €1,069.
  → Women earn **€242/month less** on average, and the **gap widened by ~71 %** in absolute euro terms over the decade \[7\].

Conclusion:

> There is a **non‑trivial gender pay gap** (around **8–15 %** by different measures), with women concentrated in lower‑paid roles and earning significantly less in net terms.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage contrasts

Occupation‑ and region‑based 2025 guides paint a clear hierarchy \[6\]:

**By sector (annualized, ballpark):**

- **IT & Software:**
  – Entry: **€25k–€40k/year**
  – Mid: **€30k–€60k/year**
  – Senior: **€60k+**.

- **Finance & Banking:**
  – Typically **€30k–€50k/year**, more in senior/fintech roles.

- **Tourism & Hospitality:**
  – **€1,000–€1,500/month** + tips, i.e. **€12k–€18k/year**.

- **Education & Public Sector:**
  – “Modest but steady” – typically around or slightly above the **national median**.

- **Manufacturing & Skilled Trades:**
  – “Competitive in modern clusters” – often **€1,300–€2,500/month**.

**By region \[6\]:**

- **Lisbon:**
  – Average ≈ **€2,200–€2,300/month** (~€31k/year).
  – Clear **top‑pay region**, concentrating finance, tech, HQs.

- **Porto:**
  – Average ≈ **€1,800–€2,000/month** (~10–20 % below Lisbon).

- **Algarve:**
  – ≈ **€1,000–€1,500/month** (tourism‑heavy, seasonal).

- **Coimbra / Madeira / Azores:**
  – **€1,400–€1,700/month**, around or slightly below national averages.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income

For living standards, **net household income** matters most.

From INE/TradingEconomics and regional median‑income data \[5\]\[6\]:

- **Average net wage per person, Q3 2025:** **€1,250/month**.
- **Median net income per capita (2023):** **€11,446/year** ≈ **€954/month** \[6\].

Assuming **average household size ≈ 2.4 people**, a **typical household** has:

- **Median‑type net household income:**
  – ≈ **€954 × 2.4 ≈ €2,300/month** (rough) based strictly on 2023 per‑capita income.
  – Many 2025 guides use **≈ €3,000/month net** as a practical “middle household” benchmark once wage growth and dual‑earner households are accounted for.

A simple, usable **2025 household picture**:

> - **Typical net household income:** **≈ €2,500–3,000/month**.
> - **Lisbon middle‑class households** tend toward the top of that range or above; **interior/rural households** are often lower.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Statistics Portugal’s 2024 income and living conditions release:

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income (2024):** **30.9 %** (down from 31.9 % in 2023) \[1\].

On the 0–1 scale: **Gini ≈ 0.309**.

Interpretation:

- Portugal is **moderately unequal**:
  – **More equal** than high‑inequality cases like the US or Latin America.
  – **Slightly more unequal** than very egalitarian EU countries (Nordics, Czechia, Slovenia).

The **decrease** from 31.9 % to 30.9 % suggests a **recent mild improvement** in income distribution.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and incidence

From the same INE release \[1\]:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty threshold (equivalised disposable income):**
  – **€8,679/year** → **€723/month** per adult equivalent.

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (2024):**
  – **15.4 %** of the population.

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty or social exclusion (AROPE):**
  – **19.7 %** (2024),
  – Estimated to fall to **18.6 % in 2025**, i.e. **~1.995 million people** \[1\].

So:

> About **1 in 6 Portuguese** live **below the national poverty line**, and about **1 in 5** are **at risk of poverty or social exclusion** once low work intensity and material deprivation are accounted for.

Elderly households have seen some of the **largest recent improvements**, but **regional disparities** are large: **Alentejo and interior regions** have much higher poverty rates than **Lisbon and coastal areas**.

## 3. Portugal’s GDP – Size, Growth, and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person

From the Portugal economy profile (IMF‑based) \[9\]:

- **Nominal GDP 2025:** **\$337.9 billion**.
- **Population:** **≈ 10.5 million**.

Thus:

- **Nominal GDP per capita 2025:** **\$31,415**.

### 3.2 PPP GDP per capita

Same IMF/World Bank sources:

- **GDP per capita (PPP), 2025:** **\$49,753** \[9\].

So, in global context:

> Portugal is a **high‑income economy** with **PPP output per head just below \$50k**, close to but slightly below richer EU peers like France, Germany, Netherlands.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

Macroeconomic projections for 2025 show:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025:** **≈ 1.9–2.0 %** \[9\].
- **Inflation (headline, 2025):** **≈ 2.2 %**, down from **2.7 % in 2024**, and expected to edge toward **2.0 %** in 2026 \[8\]\[9\].

So Portugal in 2025 has:

- **Moderate real growth**,
- **Low, near‑target inflation** (essentially in ECB’s comfort zone).

### 3.4 Labour market

Key 2025 labour indicators:

- **Unemployment rate:**
  – **6.2–6.4 %** early 2025, falling to **~5.9 % by October 2025** \[8\].
- **Long‑term unemployment rate (Q3 2025):** **2.1 %** \[8\].

This is a **relatively tight labour market** by EU standards, though:

- **Youth unemployment** and
- **Regional under‑employment** remain higher than the aggregate suggests.

## 4. GDP vs Wages vs Incomes – How They Line Up

Putting the main numbers next to each other:

| Metric (Portugal ≈2025) | Approximate value |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per person** | **\$31,415** |
| **PPP GDP per person** | **\$49,753** |
| **Average gross wage (per worker)** | **€1,741/month** |
| **Median gross wage (per worker)** | **≈ €1,320/month** |
| **Minimum wage (mainland)** | **€870/month** (14×) |
| **Average net wage (per worker)** | **€1,250/month** |
| **Median per‑capita net income** | **≈ €954/month** (2023) |
| **Typical household net income** | **≈ €2,500–3,000/month** |
| **Poverty line (per adult equivalent)** | **€723/month** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate** | **15.4 %** |
| **AROPE (poverty or social exclusion)** | **~18.6–19.7 %** |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | **0.309** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 5.9–6.4 %** |
| **Inflation** | **≈ 2.2 %** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 1.9–2.0 %** |

### 4.1 Main relationships

1. **GDP per head vs typical personal incomes**
   - GDP/head (\$31.4k) is **well above** a typical **per‑person disposable income** (≈ €11.4k/year ≈ \$13k).
   - This is expected: GDP includes **corporate profits, government spending, depreciation**, and is spread over **children, non‑employed adults and pensioners**, not only active workers.

2. **Average vs median wages**
   - The **average wage (€1,741)** sits **noticeably above** the **median (~€1,320)**, so using the mean as “what people earn” overstates the income of the typical worker.
   - Lisbon and high‑pay sectors (IT, finance) **pull the mean up** relative to the national centre.

3. **Wages vs household income and poverty**
   - A **single worker on the median wage** (~€1.3k gross, maybe €1k net) supporting a **multi‑person household** will sit **near or below the poverty threshold** (€723/month per adult equivalent, and more for families).
   - **Dual‑earner households** or those with higher‑paid professionals can more easily reach **€2.5–3k/month net**, i.e. comfortable middle‑income terrain.

4. **Inequality and exclusion**
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.31** and **~15 % at‑risk‑of‑poverty**, Portugal is **not extremely unequal**, but there is a clear **lower‑income segment**: rural, older, and some urban households that live very close to or below the poverty line.
   - Spatial gaps (Lisbon vs interior) and sector gaps (IT/finance vs hospitality/agriculture) are key drivers.

5. **Growth, inflation, and real incomes**
   - With **real GDP growth ~2 %** and **inflation just over 2 %**, and with **labour‑cost index and wages rising ~5–6 %**, most workers are seeing **some real wage gains**, though housing costs (especially in Lisbon/Porto) eat into those gains.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Portugal, ≈2025)

### 5.1 Individual worker (gross, per month)

Useful **Portugal‑wide brackets**:

- **\< €1,000**
  – Often **minimum‑wage/part‑time/low‑skill**. Risk of **poverty**, especially with dependants or in Lisbon.

- **€1,000–€1,500**
  – **Lower‑middle range**; around the **median**; typical for many service, public‑sector, junior office roles.

- **€1,500–€2,200**
  – **Middle to upper‑middle**; common for experienced office staff, skilled technicians, many professionals outside Lisbon’s top tier.

- **€2,200–€3,500**
  – **Comfortable upper‑middle**; mid‑senior IT, engineering, finance; strong purchasing power outside top Lisbon neighbourhoods.

- **> €3,500**
  – **High income nationally**; senior management, very specialised professionals or top‑end tech/finance.

### 5.2 Household (net, per month, ~2–3 people)

For a typical **2–3 person household**:

- **\< €1,800/month**
  – Frequently **near or below the poverty line**, especially in big cities or with children.

- **€1,800–€2,800/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**; essentials are covered, but little buffer for savings or major shocks.

- **€2,800–€4,000/month**
  – **Core middle class**; comfortable in most of the country, can save modestly and manage typical housing costs.

- **€4,000–€6,000/month**
  – **Upper‑middle**; comfortable even in Lisbon, able to save, invest, and travel.

- **> €6,000/month**
  – **Affluent**; strong financial security relative to the median.

## 6. Short “Portugal 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Portugal** is a **moderately unequal, high‑income Eurozone economy** with **nominal GDP per person around \$31,400** and **PPP GDP per head close to \$49,800**, growing at **about 2 % per year** with **inflation around 2.2 %**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **€1,320/month gross**, while the **average gross wage** is higher at **€1,741/month**, and the **statutory minimum wage** in mainland Portugal is **€870/month** (14 payments). After taxes and transfers, a **typical household** has about **€2,500–3,000/month net**, but **around 15 % of the population** still lives **below the national poverty line**, and **nearly 1 in 5** is **at risk of poverty or social exclusion**. Income inequality (Gini ≈ 0.31) is moderate by global standards, yet **regional divides** (Lisbon vs interior) and **sectoral gaps** (IT/finance vs tourism/hospitality) are large, and a **persistent gender pay gap** means women earn substantially less than men on average. Overall, Portugal combines **solid macro stability and gradual real‑income gains** with a **still‑fragile lower‑income segment** and **high housing costs in major cities**, which make the “headline averages” feel distant from many households’ everyday experience.
