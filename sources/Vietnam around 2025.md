# Vietnam around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the Vietnam “turn”, aligned with the structure of your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Vietnam (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) worker

Official labour statistics and 2025 wage overviews show a very consistent picture of worker earnings:

- **Average/median‑type monthly income of workers, 2025**
  - Q1 2025: **≈ 8.3 million VND/month** (≈ **US \$320–325** at ≈ 26,000 VND/US\$) [1][2][6].
  - Q2 2025: **≈ 8.2 million VND/month**; full‑year 2025 average ≈ **8.4 million VND/month** (≈ **US \$320**)[1][6].

Because the distribution is not extremely skewed, this **average wage is a good proxy for a “typical” worker’s pay**:

> **Typical (median‑type) full‑time worker, 2025:**
> **≈ 8.3–8.4 million VND per month** → **≈ 100 million VND per year**
> ≈ **US \$320–325/month** → **US \$3,800–3,900/year**.

Assuming a 38‑hour week (~165 hours/month):

- **Implied median hourly wage:**
  \[
  \approx \frac{8.3\,\text{m VND}}{165} \approx 50{,}000\,\text{VND/hour} \approx \text{US \$1.9/hour}.
  \]

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

GSO data and private surveys converge on similar figures:

- **Average wage (all employees), mid‑2025:**
  - **≈ 8.3–8.4 million VND/month** (≈ **US \$320–325**)[1][2][6].
- Sectoral averages are higher than this aggregate figure in services and industry (see 1.5).

Because **average and median are quite close**, Vietnam does **not** yet show the very extreme wage skew seen in many richer economies.

### 1.3 Regional minimum wage (no single national floor)

Vietnam uses **four minimum‑wage regions** for contract workers:

| Region | 2025 monthly minimum | Approx. US \$ / month* | Typical areas |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **I**  | **4.96 million VND** | **≈ US \$190–195**     | Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, top urban centres |
| **II** | **4.41 million VND** | **≈ US \$170**         | Secondary cities, provincial hubs |
| **III**| **3.86 million VND** | **≈ US \$145–150**     | Developing provinces |
| **IV** | **3.45 million VND** | **≈ US \$130–135**     | Rural & mountainous regions |

\*Using ~26,000 VND/US \$ in 2025 [3][17].

So a **full‑time minimum‑wage worker** in Region I earns:

- **≈ 4.96m ÷ 8.3m ≈ 60 % of a typical worker’s wage**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

According to a 2025 ILO diagnostic:

- **Gender pay gap (formal wage sector, monthly wages):** **≈ 13.7–13.8 %** – women earn **about 86–87 % of men’s earnings on average** [4].

This aligns with GSO snapshots:

- **Men (salaried, Q1 2025):** ~**9.8m VND/month** (≈ US \$380).
- **Women:** ~**8.9m VND/month** (≈ US \$345).

The gap is **larger in rural areas and at higher seniority levels**.

### 1.5 Sector and urban‑rural contrasts

**By broad economic sector (2025)** [2][3][8]:

| Sector                       | Avg. wage (VND/month) | US \$ / month (≈) |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Services (incl. trade, IT)** | **9.9 million**       | **≈ US \$380**    |
| **Industry & construction**  | **9.1 million**       | **≈ US \$350**    |
| **Agro‑forestry‑fishery**    | **4.9 million**       | **≈ US \$190**    |

**Urban vs rural (2024, GSO household living standards survey)** [6]:

- **Urban workers:** **≈ 9.3m VND/month** (≈ **US \$360**).
- **Rural workers:** **≈ 6.7m VND/month** (≈ **US \$260**).

**IT sector medians (2025–26)** – ITviec salary report [9]:

- **CTO/CIO/VPoE:** **≈ 101m VND/month** (≈ **US \$3,900**).
- **Back‑end / Full‑stack developer:** **≈ 37–38m VND/month** (≈ **US \$1,400–1,500**).
- **Product Owner / Project Manager / Tech Lead:** **≈ 50–52m VND/month** (≈ **US \$1,900–2,000**).
- **IT Support:** **≈ 20m VND/month** (≈ **US \$770**).

So **mid‑senior IT roles easily make 4–5× the national median wage**.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household income – what people actually live on

Two complementary views help here:

1. **Per‑capita cash income (nominal)**
   CEIC’s series on **annual household income per capita**:

   - **2024:** **US \$2,688.7 per person per year** [18].
   - Rough 2025 level (given strong growth): **≈ US \$2,800–2,900 per person/year** is plausible.

   With average household size **≈ 3.44 persons** [13], this implies a **typical household** has:

   \[
   2{,}689 \times 3.44 \approx \textbf{US \$9,250 per year}
   \]

   → **≈ US \$770–780 per month** of cash income.

2. **Self‑reported household income (2025)**
   A widely shared 2025 snapshot (consistent with the CEIC averages) reports for Vietnam [7]:

   - **National average household income:** **21.3m VND/month** → **≈ US \$809/month** → **≈ US \$9,700/year**.
   - **Hanoi & HCMC:** **26.5m VND/month** → **≈ US \$1,010/month** → **≈ US \$12,100/year**.
   - **Other regions:** **20.1m VND/month** → **≈ US \$760/month** → **≈ US \$9,150/year**.

Taken together:

> A typical 3–4 person household in Vietnam in 2025 lives on **around US \$9,000–10,000 per year in cash income**, higher in big cities and lower in poorer regions.

### 2.2 Equivalised disposable income (PPP view)

A 2025 cross‑country ranking estimates Vietnam’s **real disposable income per capita** at about **US \$12,000 (PPP)** [12].

This is:

- **Well below** advanced economies (~US \$35k–60k PPP),
- But significantly **above low‑income countries**, consistent with Vietnam’s **lower‑middle‑income** status.

If we treat this as **equivalised disposable income per standard adult**, then:

- A **“typical person”** has **~US \$12k/year PPP** of spending power.
- For a **3.4‑person household**, that translates to roughly **US \$20–25k PPP per year** in household resources.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

GSO’s Living Standards Survey and independent summaries report [8]:

- **Gini coefficient of income, 2024:** **0.372**.

Interpretation:

- **Moderate inequality**:
  - **Lower** than many Latin American economies and somewhat lower than China,
  - **Higher** than the most egalitarian EU countries.

In practice:

- Urban and IT/finance workers can have incomes **several times** the rural / informal‑sector median.
- Nonetheless, **broad‑based growth** has lifted incomes across almost all deciles over the last decade.

### 2.4 Poverty – income and multidimensional

Two key measures:

1. **World Bank LMIC poverty line (income‑based)**
   The World Bank’s **Poverty and Equity Brief (Oct 2025)** reports [10]:

   - **Poverty rate 2025 (LMIC line, \~US \$3.10/day PPP):** **3.6 %**.
   - Down from **3.8 %** in 2024.

2. **National multidimensional poverty**
   A government report summarised by Nhan Dan (Oct 2025) finds [9]:

   - **Multidimensional poverty rate 2025:** **1.3 %** of the population.
   - Down from **4.4 % in 2021**.

So:

> **Extreme and multidimensional poverty are now very low** (1–4 %), although **vulnerable near‑poor groups** remain, especially in rural and ethnic‑minority areas.

## 3. Vietnam’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Levels, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 GDP size and per‑capita output

From IMF and Vietnam‑official sources [11][13][14][15]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:**
  - Vietnam’s official and press estimates: **≈ US \$514 billion**.
- **Population mid‑2025:** **≈ 101.6 million**.

Thus:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \approx \frac{US \$514\,\text{bn}}{101.6\,\text{m}} \approx \textbf{US \$5,026 per person per year}
\]

PPP‑adjusted:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025 (IMF):** **≈ US \$18,870 per person** [14].

So in simple terms:

> Vietnam produces **≈ US \$5k of market‑priced output per person per year**, equivalent to about **US \$19k per person in PPP terms**.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth

There is a notable difference between **IMF** and **Vietnam’s official statistics**:

- **IMF WEO (Oct 2025):** **Real GDP growth 2025 ≈ 5.6 %** [14].
- **Vietnam’s GSO / Government:** **Real GDP growth 2025 = 8.02 %** (highest in 3 years) [15].

Either way, Vietnam is:

- Growing **much faster** than most advanced economies,
- Among the **stronger performers in Southeast Asia** in 2025.

### 3.3 Inflation

According to the National Statistics Office [15][1]:

- **CPI, average 2025 vs 2024:** **+3.31 %** (within the National Assembly’s 3–3.5 % target).
- **December 2025 CPI (YoY):** **+3.48 %**.

Core inflation is similar (3.1–3.3 %), indicating:

> Vietnam has **moderate, controlled inflation** around **3–3½ %**.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

Labour force surveys and macro series show [16]:

- **Unemployment rate (Q3 2025):** **2.22 %**, down from 2.24 % in Q2.
- Youth unemployment is higher (≈ 9 %), but still modest by international standards.

In short:

> Vietnam in 2025 has a **very tight labour market**, with unemployment **around 2–2.5 %** and rising wages.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Putting the main numbers side‑by‑side

| Metric (Vietnam ~2025)                          | Approx. value |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)**                    | **US \$5,026** |
| **GDP per capita (PPP, IMF)**                   | **US \$18,870** |
| **Typical full‑time wage (median‑type)**        | **8.3–8.4m VND/month ≈ US \$320–325** → **US \$3,800–3,900/year** |
| **Average wage (all employees)**                | **≈ same as median‑type** (≈ US \$3,800–3,900/year) |
| **Regional minimum wage (Region I)**            | **4.96m VND/month ≈ US \$190–195** |
| **Average net household income (3–4 people)**   | **≈ 21.3m VND/month ≈ US \$809/month ≈ US \$9,700/year** |
| **Average per‑capita income (nominal)**         | **≈ US \$2,700–2,900/year** |
| **Real disposable income per capita (PPP)**     | **≈ US \$12,000/year** |
| **Gini (income)**                               | **0.372** |
| **Poverty (LMIC line)**                         | **3.6 %** of population |
| **Multidimensional poverty**                    | **1.3 %** of population |
| **Unemployment**                                | **≈ 2.2 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI average)**                     | **≈ 3.31 %** |
| **Real GDP growth (official)**                  | **8.02 %** (IMF: 5.6 %) |

### 4.2 Key relationships

1. **GDP per head vs wages**
   - **GDP per head (US \$5k)** is **a bit higher** than the **typical worker’s annual wage (US \$3.8–3.9k)** because:
     - GDP must cover not only wages but also **profits, taxes, public spending, and depreciation**,
     - It is divided by **all residents**, not just workers (children, elderly, non‑employed).

2. **Wages vs household incomes**
   - A **single worker on the typical wage** (≈ US \$3,800/year) cannot, alone, reach the **average household income** of **≈ US \$9,700/year**.
   - Many households thus rely on:
     - **Multiple earners**,
     - **Family farming or small businesses**,
     - **Remittances and informal earnings**.

3. **Mean vs median income**
   - The gap between **average per‑capita income (US \$2.7–2.9k)** and **real disposable per‑capita income in PPP (≈ US \$12k)** shows:
     - **Prices in Vietnam are much lower** than in rich countries (hence the PPP uplift).
     - **Living standards measured in local purchasing power terms** are **better than raw dollar incomes suggest**, though still well below rich‑country levels.

4. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - A **Gini of 0.37** indicates **moderate inequality**: IT, finance and urban professionals can earn many times rural and low‑skill wages.
   - But **income poverty is now low** (3–4 %), and **multidimensional poverty is just 1.3 %**, reflecting **broad‑based growth and targeted poverty programs**.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Vietnam 2025)

### 5.1 Individual worker – gross monthly pay

Approximate tiers:

- **< 6m VND/month (≈ < US \$230)**
  → Typically **very low income or part‑time/informal**, often below minimum wage in Regions I–II.

- **6–8m VND/month (≈ US \$230–310)**
  → **Lower‑middle range**: entry‑level factory jobs, basic office or service roles.

- **8–12m VND/month (≈ US \$310–460)**
  → **Around the national “typical” range**: many full‑time workers in manufacturing, services, junior white‑collar roles.

- **12–20m VND/month (≈ US \$460–770)**
  → **Upper‑middle**: experienced office staff, supervisors, some engineers and IT support.

- **> 20m VND/month (≈ > US \$770)**
  → **High income by national standards**; mid‑senior professionals, tech, foreign firms, senior management.

### 5.2 Household – net monthly income (3–4 people)

- **< 15m VND/month (≈ < US \$580)**
  → Often **poor or near‑poor**; vulnerable to shocks, especially in urban areas with high housing costs.

- **15–25m VND/month (≈ US \$580–960)**
  → **Lower‑middle to basic middle class**; can cover essentials, limited savings.

- **25–35m VND/month (≈ US \$960–1,350)**
  → **Comfortable middle class**, especially outside central Hanoi/HCMC; some scope for saving, education, and better housing.

- **> 35m VND/month (≈ > US \$1,350)**
  → **Upper‑middle/affluent**, often dual‑earner professionals, senior managers or successful business owners.

## 6. Short “Vietnam 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Vietnam** is a **fast‑growing, lower‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP around US \$514 billion**, **GDP per person about US \$5,000**, and **PPP GDP per head near US \$18,900**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **8.3–8.4 million VND/month (≈ US \$320)**, while **minimum wages** range from **3.45m to 4.96m VND/month** depending on region. After taxes and transfers, a **typical household** of 3–4 people has about **US \$9,000–10,000 per year** in cash income, and **real disposable income** averages **~US \$12,000 per person (PPP)**. Inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.37)**, and poverty has fallen sharply, with only **3–4 %** of people below the World Bank’s income line and **1.3 %** in multidimensional poverty. With **real GDP growth between 5.6 % (IMF) and 8.0 % (official)**, **inflation around 3.3 %**, and **unemployment near 2.2 %**, Vietnam combines **strong macroeconomic performance and rapidly rising wages** with remaining **urban–rural gaps and sectoral disparities**, especially between high‑pay IT/urban jobs and low‑pay agricultural and informal work.
