# Singapore around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Singapore “turn”**, in the same style as your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Singapore (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) worker

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) advance release and press coverage for 2025 show that:

- **Median gross monthly income from work (full‑time employed residents, incl. employer CPF)**:
  - **2024:** **S\$5,500** [2][3].
  - **2025:** **S\$5,775** – **+5 % nominal**, **+4.3 % real** [1][3][4].

So a good 2025 “typical worker” benchmark is:

> **Median gross monthly income (full‑time resident, incl. employer CPF, 2025):**
> **≈ S\$5,775/month** → **≈ S\$69,300/year**.

Assuming ~173–175 working hours/month:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**
  5,775 ÷ 174 ≈ **S\$33/hour**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Several 2025 salary compendia synthesising MOM and market data report:

- **Average gross monthly wage (all employees, 2025):** **≈ S\$6,282/month** [5].
- TradingEconomics’ national‑accounts based series gives:
  - **Average monthly wages, Q3 2025:** **S\$6,429/month** [6].

These are close enough that we can treat **S\$6.3–6.4k/month** as the central 2025 mean.

So, side by side:

- **Median gross wage, 2025:** **S\$5,775/month**.
- **Average gross wage, 2025:** **≈ S\$6,300–6,400/month**.

The mean is roughly **9–11 % higher than the median**, indicating **some upper‑tail skew** (finance, tech, senior professional roles) but not as extreme as in very unequal economies.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Singapore **does not have a single national minimum wage**. Instead, it uses:

- **Progressive Wage Model (PWM)** sectoral wage floors (e.g. cleaning, security, landscape, retail, F&B).
- **Local Qualifying Salary (LQS)** that sets a minimum wage level for local workers a firm must pay to count them towards foreign‑worker quota.

Key implications:

- There is **no universal \“minimum monthly wage\”** comparable to Europe/Latin America.
- **Low‑wage full‑time jobs** in covered sectors commonly sit around the **S\$1,500–2,500/month** band in 2024–25, well below the **median S\$5,775**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

MOM’s 2025 update on the gender wage gap finds:

- **Adjusted gender pay gap, 2025:** **6.0 %** – women earn **6 % less** than men after adjusting for occupation, age, education, and industry [7][8].
- This has narrowed from **8.8 % in 2002** [8].

Unadjusted medians remain larger:

- 2023 data show women earning **≈14.3 % less** than men on median income [9][10].
- Early 2024 numbers show a **men’s median salary ~11.1 % higher** than women’s [11].

So:

> After correcting for job characteristics, the gender wage gap is **moderate (6 %)**, but in raw terms women still earn **≈10–15 % less** than men on median.

### 1.5 Sector and role differences

2025 salary‑guide compilations (Mercer, Robert Half, Michael Page, etc.) converge on:

- **High‑pay sectors**:
  - **Finance (banking, asset mgmt, insurance)** – common mid‑career ranges **S\$8k–15k/month**, senior roles higher.
  - **Technology / IT / data / cybersec** – many skilled professionals on **S\$7k–14k/month**, senior engineers and managers more.
  - **Healthcare specialists** (doctors, senior pharmacists) – often **S\$10k+/month**.

- **Middle‑pay sectors**:
  - **Professional services, engineering, higher‑education, public sector** – broad cluster around **S\$4k–8k/month** for mid‑career professionals.

- **Lower‑pay sectors**:
  - **Hospitality, basic retail, cleaning, security, some F&B jobs** – many roles **S\$1.5k–3k/month**, often covered by PWM.

Regional differences are limited within Singapore; **sector and skill level** matter much more than location.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household income – per household and per person

SingStat’s **Key Household Income Trends 2024** release gives:

- **Median monthly household income from work (resident employed households, incl. employer CPF)**:
  - **2023:** **S\$10,869**.
  - **2024:** **S\$11,297** – up **3.9 % nominal**, **1.4 % real** after inflation [12][13].

Household income from all sources (wages, self‑employment, investment, transfers) is higher:

- **Average monthly household income from all sources, 2023:** **S\$15,473** [14].

Average household size:

- **Average household size, 2024:** **3.09 persons per resident household** [15][16].
- Commentary in late‑2025 HDB/household reports summarises this as **“about 3 people per household”** [17].

From these:

- **Median household employment income (2024):** **S\$11,297/month** → **~3.09 people**
  → **≈ S\$3,660 per person per month** in a median household.
- Using the “per household member” metric in SingStat’s press release, **median household employment income per household member grew to about S\$3,287 in 2022**, and similar real‑terms gains continued through 2024–25 [1][13].

Given 2025 wage growth (~5 % nominal, 4.3 % real), a reasonable 2025 picture:

> - **Median household income from work, 2025 (rough):** **S\$11.7–12.0k/month**.
> - **Median per‑person income within households:** **≈ S\$3.7–3.9k/month**.

### 2.2 Income inequality – Gini coefficient

Key points from 2025 commentary:

- Pre‑tax, pre‑transfer **Gini** has historically been **high** (~0.43–0.46).
- Government transfers and taxes **reduce the Gini** by a few points.
- PM Wong indicated in Sept 2025 that an updated measure including **asset and investment income** would show the Gini **closer to 0.38** vs **≈0.36** on the traditional official series [18].
- Statista’s 2025 forecast places Singapore’s income Gini around **0.38** [19].

So, combining these:

> **Income inequality is significant but not extreme by global standards**:
> – **Gini (disposable income, incl. transfers):** **≈ 0.36–0.38**.
> – Once asset/investment income is fully included, inequality looks **a bit higher** than the official baseline.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and rates

Singapore **does not publish an official national poverty line**:

- Government documents and academic work emphasise that **no single poverty line is defined**, and multiple targeted schemes (ComCare, etc.) use their own thresholds [20][21].

However, common reference points used in research and policy debates include:

- **Median‑relative threshold**:
  - 50 % of **median household income per household member**.
  - With 2022 median per‑member income at **S\$3,287**, 50 % gives **≈ S\$1,640/month per person** [20].
- **Household poverty baseline using 2024 medians**:
  - With 2024 median household income **S\$11,297**, 50 % is **≈ S\$5,648/month** for a household; households below this are sometimes classed as “low income” in research [22].

UN and regional poverty‑line data sometimes show **“0 % below national line”** for Singapore simply because **no official line exists**; this should **not** be read as **“no poor people”** [21].

Practical interpretation:

- A **single adult** earning **≲ S\$2–2.5k/month** has **very limited margin** after housing, transport and food.
- Households below **~S\$4–6k/month**, especially with children or elderly, are often considered **low income** in policy discussions, despite sitting well above global \$1.90/day thresholds.

## 3. Singapore’s GDP – Size, Growth and GDP per Person

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per capita

IMF / Worldometers table for 2025 shows:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:**
  - Implied from per‑capita table: population **5,870,750**, nominal GDP per capita **US\$94,481** → GDP ≈ **US\$554 billion** [23].
- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **US\$94,481** [23].

PPP side:

- IMF WEO PPP per‑capita rankings and World Economics place **Singapore’s GDP per capita (PPP)** around **US\$132k–155k** in 2025 [24][25][26].

A reasonable consolidated estimate:

> - **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ US\$94,500/year**.
> - **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ US\$130–155k/year (PPP)**.

This places Singapore at or very near the **top of global rankings** on a per‑person basis.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth

MTI’s 3Q 2025 GDP release reports that:

- **GDP growth averaged 4.3 % year‑on‑year in 2025 to date**, with strong contributions from services and manufacturing [27].

IMF and local forecasts suggest:

- **Full‑year 2025 real GDP growth** likely lands around **4–4.5 %**.

### 3.3 Inflation

MAS and MTI releases in 2025 show:

- **MAS Core Inflation (ex‑accom & private transport):**
  - Average around **0.5 % in 2025**, with a spike up to **1.2 % YoY in October** before moderating [28][29].
- **CPI‑All Items inflation:**
  - **1.2 % YoY in November 2025** [30].
  - MAS/MTI project **CPI‑All Items** to average **~1.5–2.5 %** over 2025, but out‑turns appear closer to the **lower half (~1–2 %)** [28][30].

So:

> Singapore in 2025 experiences **low inflation**:
> – **Core:** ≈ **0.5 %** average.
> – **Headline CPI:** ≈ **1–2 %**.

### 3.4 Labour market

MOM’s 2Q and 3Q 2025 Labour Market Reports show:

- **Unemployment rates (June 2025):**
  - Overall: **2.0 %**
  - Resident: **2.8 %**
  - Citizen: **2.9 %** [31].

- **Unemployment rates (September 2025):**
  - Overall: **2.0 %**
  - Resident: **2.8 %**
  - Citizen: **3.1 %** [32].

TradingEconomics confirms:

- **Seasonally‑adjusted unemployment, Q3 2025:** **2.0 %** [33].

Interpretation:

> The labour market is **tight** by global standards – unemployment around **2 %**, with **high permanent‑job shares** and low under‑utilisation.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Key numbers side‑by‑side (≈2025)

| Indicator | Approximate value |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **US\$94,481/year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **≈ US\$130–155k/year** |
| **Median gross wage (full‑time worker)** | **S\$5,775/month** (≈ S\$69.3k/year) |
| **Average gross wage (all employees)** | **≈ S\$6.3–6.4k/month** |
| **Median household income from work (2024)** | **S\$11,297/month** |
| **Typical median household income, 2025** | **≈ S\$11.7–12.0k/month** |
| **Median per‑person income in household (2024)** | **≈ S\$3.3–3.7k/month** |
| **Average household income from all sources (2023)** | **S\$15,473/month** |
| **Average household size** | **≈ 3.0–3.1 persons** |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | **≈ 0.36–0.38** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 2.0 % overall** |
| **Inflation (CPI‑All Items, 2025)** | **≈ 1–2 %** |
| **Real GDP growth, 2025** | **≈ 4–4.5 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per person vs typical worker income**

   - **GDP per head (~US\$94.5k)** is **much larger** than the **typical worker’s cash pay** once converted to USD (S\$69.3k/year ≈ US\$51–52k at ~1.33 SGD/US\$).
   - The difference reflects that:
     - A substantial part of GDP is **corporate profits, taxes, and retained earnings**,
     - Some output is consumed as **public goods** (defence, infrastructure, education) rather than paid straight into wages,
     - GDP is averaged over **children, retirees and non‑workers**, not just employed residents.

2. **Average vs median wages and incomes**

   - **Average wages** (~S\$6.3–6.4k) exceed **median wages** (~S\$5.8k) by **≈10 %**, signalling a **non‑trivial but not extreme upper tail**.
   - **Average household income from all sources (S\$15.5k)** is significantly above **median household employment income (S\$11.3k)**, reflecting:
     - Higher incomes among top deciles,
     - Additional non‑labour income (investments, rentals),
     - And that averages are pushed up by high‑earning households.

3. **Inequality overlay**

   - A **Gini around 0.36–0.38** (after transfers) places Singapore as:
     - **More unequal** than egalitarian European countries,
     - **Less unequal** than classic high‑inequality states.
   - Including **asset and investment income** probably **raises** effective inequality somewhat, as wealth is highly concentrated.

4. **Poverty and lower‑income benchmarks**

   - With no official poverty line, analysts often use **50 % of median household income or per‑member income**. On that basis:
     - Households earning **≲ S\$5.5–6k/month** (depending on size) are **low‑income** relative to the middle.
     - A single person on **S\$2–2.5k/month** is far from destitution by global standards but has **limited slack** in an expensive city.

5. **Macro environment vs lived experience**

   - **Real median income grew 4.3 % in 2025** with **core inflation around 0.5 %** and **headline ≈1–2 %**, so typical workers and households saw **solid real gains** [1][3][28].
   - Yet **housing, childcare and eldercare costs** remain significant. The result is that aggregate GDP and income statistics look outstanding, but **subjective cost‑of‑living pressure** is still a key political and social issue.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Singapore 2025)

### 5.1 Individual worker – gross monthly income (S\$)

Very rough **Singapore‑wide** brackets for a full‑time resident:

- **\< S\$3,000/month**
  – **Lower income**; typical for entry‑level service work, PWM sectors, some support roles. Tight in Singapore unless living with family or sharing costs.

- **S\$3,000–5,000/month**
  – **Lower‑middle to mid range**; common for junior professionals, admin staff, technicians. Around or modestly below the national median.

- **S\$5,000–8,000/month**
  – **Core middle to upper‑middle**; around and above the median; many mid‑career professionals, engineers, teachers, mid‑level managers.

- **S\$8,000–15,000/month**
  – **Upper‑middle to high income**; common in finance, technology, senior public sector roles, specialist healthcare.

- **\> S\$15,000/month**
  – **Top income tier** nationally; senior executives, partners, high‑end banking & tech, successful entrepreneurs.

### 5.2 Households – monthly income from work (S\$)

For a **3‑person resident employed household**:

- **\< S\$5,000/month**
  – Often considered **low‑income**, and in practice below 50 % of median for such a household.

- **S\$5,000–8,000/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**; basics can be covered but with limited savings, especially with children or elderly dependants.

- **S\$8,000–13,000/month**
  – **Broad middle class**; includes the **median household (≈ S\$11–12k)**; able to manage HDB mortgage, schooling, and some savings.

- **S\$13,000–20,000/month**
  – **Upper‑middle**; comfortable in most parts of Singapore, good savings and investment capacity.

- **\> S\$20,000/month**
  – **Affluent/upper tier**; clearly above typical living standards.

## 6. Short “Singapore 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Singapore** is one of the **richest economies on Earth**, with **nominal GDP per person about US\$94,500** and **PPP GDP per head around US\$130–155k**. A **typical full‑time resident worker** earns roughly **S\$5,775/month** (≈ **S\$69k/year**) in gross income including employer CPF, while the **average wage** is higher, around **S\$6.3–6.4k/month**, reflecting a moderate upper‑income tail. **Median monthly household income from work** reached **S\$11,297 in 2024** and is likely around **S\$11.7–12k in 2025**, for an average household of about **three people**, so a typical person lives on **S\$3.5–4k/month** inside the household. There is **no national minimum wage**, but sectoral wage floors and a tight labour market keep **headline unemployment around 2 %**, while **real median income grew 4.3 % in 2025** amid very **low core inflation (~0.5 %)**. The **Gini coefficient (~0.36–0.38 after transfers)** shows **notable but not extreme income inequality**, and although Singapore does not define an official poverty line, households under roughly **half the median (≲ S\$5–6k/month)** are considered **low‑income** in many analyses. Overall, Singapore combines **exceptional GDP and income levels, fast real income growth and low unemployment** with **meaningful inequality and high living costs**, so that the lived experience of many lower‑ and lower‑middle income households is considerably tighter than the headline averages suggest.
