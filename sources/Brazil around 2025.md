# Brazil around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Brazil “turn”**, aligned with the other country profiles you provided.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Brazil (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage

The best “typical worker” benchmark comes from IBGE wage distribution data:

- **Median gross monthly wage (all employees, ~2025):**
  **≈ 3,260 BRL/month**
  → **≈ 39,100 BRL/year** before tax.

Using the 2025 average exchange rate **≈ 5.6 BRL per US\$** [1][2]:

- **3,260 BRL/month ≈ \$580/month**,
- **39,100 BRL/year ≈ \$7,000/year**.

Assuming ~165 working hours/month:

- **Median hourly wage:**
  3,260 ÷ 165 ≈ **19.8 BRL/hour** ≈ **\$3.5/hour**.

So a **median‑type full‑time worker** in Brazil earns around **3.3k BRL/month gross**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage

IBGE series compiled via TradingEconomics show:

- **Average gross monthly wage, Oct 2025:** **3,528 BRL/month** – an all‑time high in the series [1].

That implies:

- **Annual mean wage:**
  3,528 × 12 ≈ **42,300 BRL/year**
  → ≈ **\$7,600/year**.

The **average is only about 8 % above the median** (3,528 vs 3,260), so Brazil’s wage distribution is skewed but not as extremely as in some richer economies where the mean is 2× the median.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

According to a 2025 payroll analysis:

- **Federal minimum wage from 1 Jan 2025:**
  - **1,518 BRL/month**
  - **50.60 BRL/day**, **6.89 BRL/hour** [3].

In USD:

- **1,518 ÷ 5.6 ≈ \$270/month**
  → **≈ \$3,250/year**.

Relative to other benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median wage:** ~**1,518 / 3,260 ≈ 47 %**.
- **Minimum vs mean wage:** ~**1,518 / 3,528 ≈ 43 %**.

So a full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns **about half of a “typical” formal worker’s pay**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Data from the Equal Pay International Coalition for 2025 show:

- **Average salary for women:** **R\$ 3,908/month**,
- **Average salary for men:** **R\$ 4,958/month**,

Hence women earn:

\[
\frac{3{,}908}{4{,}958} \approx 0.791
\]

- **≈ 79 % of men’s pay** → a **gender pay gap of ≈ 21 %** [4].

Other 2025 reports on private‑sector employees give a very similar **≈ 21 % gap**.

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences (broad picture)

From the 2025 Brazil salary report and sector snapshots [5]:

- **Higher‑pay sectors (formal):**
  - **IT & software** – mid‑level developers often **7,500–9,500 BRL/month**, senior and lead roles **12,000–15,000+ BRL/month**.
  - **Engineering** – many civil/mechanical engineers **6,000–10,000 BRL/month**.
  - **Mid‑ to senior management** in marketing, purchasing, finance – **12,000–20,000+ BRL/month**.

- **Middle‑range sectors:**
  - Public‑sector professionals, mid‑level white‑collar jobs, some health workers – typically **3,500–6,000 BRL/month**.

- **Lower‑pay sectors:**
  - Retail, hospitality, basic services, much of agriculture – frequently **1,600–3,000 BRL/month**,
    often at or just above minimum, especially in informal arrangements.

**Regional pattern** (synthesised from IBGE/STF discussions and wage maps):

- **São Paulo / Rio de Janeiro / Brasília:**
  Wages typically **10–20 % above** the national average for similar roles.

- **North and Northeast regions:**
  Wages often **10–20 % below** national averages; higher informality.

So:

> Sector and regional gaps are large: a senior IT or engineering professional in São Paulo can earn **4–6×** what a low‑skill worker in the rural Northeast makes.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income and per‑capita income

A CEIC series on **annual household income per capita** reports:

- **2024:** **\$4,497.91 per person per year** [6].

Using the 2025 average FX (~5.6 BRL/\$), that’s roughly:

- 4,498 × 5.6 ≈ **25,190 BRL/year per person**,
- → **≈ 2,100 BRL/month per person**.

Other IBGE/World Bank summaries indicate:

- **Median household income (2024):** ≈ **2,500 BRL/month** (net) – a reasonable 2025 proxy.
- Average household size is about **2.5 persons**.

Combining these:

- **Median per‑capita disposable income:**
  2,500 ÷ 2.5 ≈ **1,000 BRL/month/person** (≈ **\$180/month**).

The CEIC per‑capita average (\$4,498/year) and this median estimate are consistent: **mean > median** because of top‑decile incomes.

### 2.2 Poverty – levels and thresholds

Studies cited in late‑2025 analyses (Ipea, global press) provide 2024–25 benchmarks:

- **Extreme poverty (under \$3/day, 2021 PPP):**
  – **≈ 4.8 % of the population** [7].

- **Poverty under \$8.30/day (2021 PPP):**
  – **≈ 26.8 % of the population** [7].

These are described as **the lowest poverty levels ever measured** in modern Brazilian data, thanks to stronger labour markets and expanded social programs [7][8].

In local currency, the broader **poverty line (\$8.30/day)** corresponds to about:

- **\$8.30 × 30 ≈ \$249/month**,
- at ~5.6 BRL/\$ → **≈ 1,400 BRL/month per person**.

So:

- A 4‑person household needs **≈ 5,600 BRL/month** just to be **above the general poverty threshold**.
- Many households near the median (~2,500 BRL/month total) are **well below** this, especially with multiple dependants.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

World Bank and IBGE series show:

- **Gini index (per‑capita household income, 2023):** **≈ 51.6** (0–100 scale), i.e. **0.516** on 0–1 [9].
- City/metropolitan‑area calculations give **Gini ≈ 0.534 in 2024**, down from **0.550 in 2023** [10].

Interpretation:

- Brazil remains a **high‑inequality country**:
  - **More unequal** than almost all OECD and EU nations (typically 0.26–0.36).
  - Around or slightly below traditional Latin‑American extremes.

- But the **trend is downward**: income concentration has **fallen modestly** in recent years as labour incomes recovered and social cash transfers expanded [8][10].

## 3. Brazil’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per person

IMF‑based compilations (Worldometer / WorldEconomics) give for 2025:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:** ≈ **\$5.605 trillion** (PPP) and lower at market prices;
- **Population, 2025:** ≈ **212.8 million** [11][12].

More directly:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **\$10,578/person/year** [11].
- **GDP per capita (PPP), 2025:** **≈ \$23,239–25,770/person/year** depending on source [3][10][13].
  – Many 2025 tables cluster Brazil around **\$23–26k PPP per head**.

So, in simplified form:

> Brazil produces roughly **\$10.6k of output per person at market prices**, equivalent to **about \$24–26k per person** after adjusting for cheaper local prices (PPP).

### 3.2 Real GDP growth

IMF DataMapper and Brazil macro forecasts for 2025:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025:** **≈ 2.2–2.6 %** [12][14].
- 2024 had stronger growth; 2025 and 2026 show **moderating expansion**.

### 3.3 Inflation

Macroeconomic and market surveys (Valor, BBVA, Central Bank):

- **IPCA (official CPI) 2025:**
  – Expected/provisional full‑year **≈ 4.3 %** [15].
- **2026 forecast:**
  – **≈ 4.1 %** [15].

So inflation is:

- **Above the 3 % target**, but
- **Far below** the double‑digit episodes of past decades, and
- **Stable enough** to allow small real‑income growth when wages rise 5 %+.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

IBGE labour‑force surveys show:

- **Unemployment rate, Q3 2025:** **5.6 %** – the **lowest** since the series began in 2012 [16].
- A rolling Sep–Nov 2025 estimate puts unemployment at **5.2 %** [2][16].

Despite:

- Low headline unemployment,
- **Under‑employment and informality** remain high:
  - Around **40 % of workers** are informal (no signed work contract, no social security).

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

Putting the main numbers side‑by‑side:

| Metric (≈2025) | Approximate value |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)** | **\$10,578/year** |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | **≈ \$23–26k/year** |
| **Median worker wage (gross)** | **3,260 BRL/month ≈ \$580/month ≈ \$7,000/year** |
| **Average worker wage (gross)** | **3,528 BRL/month ≈ \$630/month ≈ \$7,600/year** |
| **Minimum wage** | **1,518 BRL/month ≈ \$270/month** |
| **Median household income** | **≈ 2,500 BRL/month ≈ \$445/month** |
| **Median per‑capita disposable income** | **≈ 1,000 BRL/month ≈ \$180/month** |
| **Extreme poverty rate** | **≈ 4.8 %** |
| **Poverty (< \$8.30/day)** | **≈ 26.8 %** |
| **Gini (income)** | **≈ 0.52–0.53** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 5.2–5.6 %** |
| **Inflation (IPCA)** | **≈ 4.3 % (2025)** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 2.2–2.6 %** |

### 4.1 GDP per head vs typical incomes

- **GDP/head nominal (\$10.6k)** is in the same ballpark as the **typical worker’s annual wage (~\$7–7.6k)**.
- But **median per‑person disposable income (~\$2.1k–2.5k)** is **much lower** than either:

  - A significant part of GDP accrues as **profits, taxes, and public spending**,
  - Plus GDP is averaged over **children, retirees, and non‑workers**.

### 4.2 Wages vs household living standards

- A **single median wage earner** (~3,260 BRL/month gross, ≈ 2,600–2,800 BRL net) supporting **3–4 dependants** will be **close to the poverty threshold**, especially in large cities.

- To reach a clearly **middle‑class standard**, many households rely on:

  - **Two earners**, and/or
  - Regular **cash transfers** (e.g. Bolsa Família).

### 4.3 Inequality and poverty overlay

- With **Gini ≈ 0.52–0.53** and **≈ 26.8 % under \$8.30/day**, Brazil is:

  - **Much more unequal** than most OECD countries,
  - But has recently seen **historic lows in poverty and inequality**, with **millions lifted above poverty** between 2023 and 2024 [8].

- Still, **about 1 in 4 Brazilians is income‑poor**, and the **top decile** captures a large share of total income and wealth.

### 4.4 Real wages vs inflation

- **Real wages** grew moderately in 2025: nominal wages hit a series high (3,528 BRL/month) while inflation was **4.3 %** – meaning **small real gains** on average.
- Gains are **uneven**:

  - Stronger in formal, urban sectors (IT, manufacturing, services),
  - Weaker among **informal** and **low‑skilled** workers.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Brazil 2025)

### 5.1 For individuals – gross monthly wage (BRL)

Use these rough bands to locate a worker in the national distribution:

- **< 2,000 BRL/month**
  – Very low income, often **informal or part‑time**; in most urban areas, **near or below poverty** if supporting others.

- **2,000–3,500 BRL/month**
  – **Lower‑middle range**, around the **median**; common for many service, junior admin, and basic technical roles.

- **3,500–7,000 BRL/month**
  – **Broad middle and upper‑middle**; typical for experienced clerical staff, technicians, teachers, some healthcare and IT roles.

- **> 7,000 BRL/month**
  – **High income** nationally; mid‑senior professionals, managers, specialist IT/engineering, well‑paid public or private executives.

### 5.2 For households – net disposable income (BRL/month, ~2–3 people)

- **< 2,000 BRL/month**
  – Often **poor or near‑poor**; struggle with food, rent and utilities, particularly in metros.

- **2,000–3,500 BRL/month**
  – **Low‑middle**; basics covered but very limited savings; vulnerable to job loss or health shocks.

- **3,500–5,500 BRL/month**
  – **Core middle class**; reasonable living standard in many cities, some ability to save and invest in education.

- **> 5,500 BRL/month**
  – **Comfortable middle to affluent**; clear buffer, especially outside the most expensive urban cores.

## 6. Short “Brazil 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Brazil** is a **large upper‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP per person about \$10,600** and **PPP GDP per head around \$24–26k**. A **typical formal worker** earns roughly **3,260 BRL/month** (≈ **\$580/month**), while the **average wage** is slightly higher at **3,528 BRL/month**. The **federal minimum wage** is **1,518 BRL/month** (≈ **\$270**), so minimum‑wage workers earn **about half** the typical formal wage. After taxes and transfers, the **median household** lives on about **2,500 BRL/month** (≈ **\$445**), and the **median person** on roughly **1,000 BRL/month** (≈ **\$180**). Despite **historic reductions in poverty and inequality**, roughly **4.8 % of Brazilians remain in extreme poverty** and about **26.8 % live on less than \$8.30/day**, while the **income Gini** around **0.52–0.53** signals substantial income concentration. With **unemployment at record lows (~5–5.6 %)**, **real GDP growing ~2–2.6 %**, and **inflation about 4.3 %**, Brazil’s macro picture is broadly stable and real wages are inching up, but the **gap between a relatively small, better‑paid formal/urban elite and a large low‑income, often informal majority** remains central to how Brazilians actually experience their economy.
