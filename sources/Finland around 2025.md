# Finland around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Finland “turn”**, in the same style as your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Finland (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage

Statistics Finland’s latest wage‑structure release for full‑time wage and salary earners (2024, best basis for 2025) shows:

- **Median gross monthly wage (all full‑time employees):**
  - **€3,611 / month** → **≈ €43,300 / year** before tax [1][2].

Assuming ≈165 working hours per month:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**
  \[
  3{,}611 / 165 \approx €21.9/\text{hour}
  \]
  Using an average 2025 rate of **€1 ≈ \$1.13**, that is **≈ \$24.8/hour**.

So a realistic **“typical worker”** benchmark for Finland in 2024–2025 is:

> **Median full‑time wage ≈ €3,600/month gross** (≈ **\$4,100/month**, **\$49,000/year**).

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

The same Statistics Finland release gives for 2024:

- **Average gross monthly wage (full‑time employees):**
  - **€4,070 / month** → **≈ €48,800 / year** (≈ **\$55,000/year**) [3].

So:

- **Median:** €3,611
- **Mean:** €4,070

The **mean is about 13 % above the median**, showing a **moderate but clear upper tail** of higher‑paid workers (finance, IT, senior management).

Approximate **average hourly wage**:

\[
4{,}070 / 165 \approx €24.7/\text{hour} \approx \$27.9/\text{hour}
\]

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Finland has **no statutory national minimum wage**. Instead:

- Wage floors are defined in **sectoral collective agreements** that cover about **90 % of workers** [4].
- In practice, **lowest full‑time monthly wages** under major agreements (cleaning, retail, hospitality) tend to fall around:

  > **≈ €2,100–2,500 / month** (≈ **\$2,400–2,800 / month**).

Relative to the typical worker:

- **Collective‑agreement floors** are roughly **60–70 % of the median full‑time wage**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Recent Finnish and EU analyses show:

- **Unadjusted gender pay gap:** Women’s average monthly wage is **about 90 % of men’s**, i.e. a **raw gap of ≈ 10 %**.
- **Adjusted gender pay gap (same occupation, age, education, etc.):** around **6 %** – women earn **≈ 94 % of men’s pay** even after controlling for job characteristics [5].

This is **better than the OECD average**, but a **non‑trivial gap** remains.

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences

From sectoral surveys (Paylab, TEK, IT salary reports):

- **IT & software:**
  - 80 % of IT workers earn **€3,031–€6,557 gross/month**.
  - Senior developers/engineers often **€5,500–6,500/month** [IT sector survey].

- **Finance, accountancy:**
  - 80 % earn **€2,893–€5,922/month**.
  - Average in this category ≈ **€4,307/month** [finance survey].

- **Academic engineers (TEK members):**
  - **Median salary (Oct 2024):** **€5,732/month**.
  - **Average:** **€6,202/month** [TEK survey, published Jan 2025][TEK].

- **Public‑sector professionals (teachers, nurses, admin):**
  - Typically **€3,000–5,500/month**.

- **Retail, hospitality, basic services:**
  - Often **€2,100–3,000/month**, clustered near collective‑agreement floors.

**Regionally**, salaries in **Helsinki/Uusimaa** are typically **~10 % higher** than the national average for the same occupations; smaller cities and rural regions sit a bit lower, but have cheaper housing.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income

A widely cited 2025 analysis (YLE) and Statistics Finland’s income‑distribution work show:

- **Median disposable income per consumption unit, 2024:** **≈ €2,500 / month** [6].
  - The article notes that the **low‑income threshold of ~€1,500/month for a single person** corresponds to **60 % of this median**, implying:
    \[
    \text{Median} \approx \frac{€1{,}500}{0.6} \approx €2{,}500/\text{month}
    \]

This is per **consumption unit** (adult‑equivalent). For a typical 2‑person household (1.5 consumption units in the Eurostat scale: 1 + 0.5):

- **Median household disposable income:**
  \[
  2{,}500 \times 1.5 \approx €3{,}750/\text{month} \approx €45{,}000/\text{year}
  \]

For an average 2‑person household with both adults, the practical “middle household” income is **around €4,000–5,000/month net**.

OECD’s 2025 Economic Survey gives:

- **Median disposable household income (PPP, 2022):** **35.1 thousand USD PPP/year** [8].

That corresponds broadly to **≈ €30–32k/year** on a PPP‑adjusted basis for the typical Finnish household.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Two slightly different but consistent indicators:

- **Statistics Finland (income distribution stats, 2024):**
  - **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income = 28.4 (0–100 scale)** → **0.284** [10].

- **Eurostat’s harmonised Gini for 2024:**
  - **26.1 %** (0.261) [11].

Either way, Finland has:

> **Low income inequality by global standards**, slightly below the EU average (~0.29–0.31), on par with the more egalitarian countries in Europe.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and incidence

Using the EU definition (**60 % of median equivalised income**) [6]:

- **Poverty threshold for single adult (2024):**
  - **≈ €1,500 / month** (≈ **€18,000 / year**).

Derived examples:

- **Couple (2 adults):**
  - Equivalence scale = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 → poverty line ≈ **€2,250 / month**.
- **Couple with two children:**
  - Equivalence scale ≈ 1 + 1 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 2.6 → poverty line ≈ **€3,900 / month**.

Incidence:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (AROPE‑income component, 2024):**
  - **≈ 12.6 %** of the population [12].
- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty or social exclusion (AROPE)** including low work intensity and material deprivation:
  - **16.9 % in 2023**, i.e. about **930,000 people** [13].

So:

> About **1 in 8 Finns** are **income‑poor**, and about **1 in 6** are **at risk of poverty or social exclusion** on the broader EU indicator.

## 3. Finland’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Levels, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person

IMF/Worldometers data for 2025:

- **Nominal GDP:** **≈ \$560 billion** [14].
- **Population:** **≈ 5.62 million** [15].

Thus:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per capita (2025)} \approx \$56{,}084 \text{ per person}
\]

### 3.2 GDP per capita – PPP

IMF WEO PPP data (via Worldometers):

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ \$66,512 per person** [16].

Finland is in the **top global tier** of income per head, somewhat below Norway/Denmark but above most large EU economies.

### 3.3 Real GDP growth

IMF’s October 2025 WEO:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025:** **≈ 1.3 %** (annual change in real GDP) [17].

Other sources (Bank of Finland, EC, MoF) give a range from **0.1–1.3 %**, so **1.3 %** serves as a reasonable central estimate.

### 3.4 Inflation

Statistics Finland and EU forecasts show:

- **Year‑on‑year CPI (Oct 2025):** **–0.2 %** (mild deflation) [18].
- **Full‑year inflation 2025 (EC forecast):** **≈ 1.9 %** [19].

So:

> Inflation in 2025 is **low and around the ECB’s target**, with some months slightly negative.

### 3.5 Labour market

TradingEconomics (Statistics Finland source):

- **Unemployment rate (Nov 2025, NSA):** **≈ 9.7 %** [20].
- Seasonally adjusted Eurostat series shows **~9.8 %** in September 2025 [20].

This is **high for a Nordic country**, and Finland recorded the **highest unemployment rate in the EU** in late 2025 according to Eurostat‑based news reports.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Household Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key indicators side‑by‑side

| Indicator (≈2025) | Approx. value |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)** | **\$56,084 / year** |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | **\$66,512 / year** |
| **Median gross wage (individual)** | **€3,611/month ≈ \$4,100/month** |
| **Average gross wage (individual)** | **€4,070/month ≈ \$4,600/month** |
| **Collective‑agreement “floor” (full‑time)** | **≈ €2,100–2,500/month** |
| **Median disposable income per consumption unit** | **≈ €2,500/month** |
| **Median disposable household income (PPP)** | **≈ \$35,100/year** |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)** | **0.28–0.30** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (60 % median)** | **≈ 12.6 %** |
| **AROPE (poverty or social exclusion)** | **≈ 16.9 %** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 9.5–9.8 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, 2025)** | **≈ 1.9 % (full‑year)** |
| **Real GDP growth (2025)** | **≈ 1.3 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs individual wages**
   - **GDP/head (\$56k)** is **higher than a typical worker’s gross pay (~\$49k/year)** but not wildly so; this is expected, because GDP also includes:
     - **Profits**,
     - **Taxes and social contributions**,
     - **Public consumption and investment**,
     - **Depreciation**.

2. **Wages vs disposable income**
   - A **median earner** on **€3,611/month gross** will net perhaps **€2,800–3,000/month** after taxes and social charges.
   - For a **2‑person household**, this is only modestly above the **poverty threshold (≈ €2,250/month)** for such a household.
   - Many **middle‑class households** depend on **two incomes** (both near or above median) to reach **€4,500–6,000/month net**.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.28**, Finland is **one of the more equal** income distributions in the OECD.
   - Still, **12–13 % of people** are income‑poor and **~17 %** are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, with:
     - Higher rates among **single parents**,
     - **Long‑term unemployed**,
     - Some **rural and eastern regions**,
     - Certain **migrant/ethnic minorities**.

4. **Growth vs labour market stress**
   - **GDP grows slowly (+1.3 %)** and inflation is low, so **average real incomes improve a little**.
   - But **unemployment near 10 %** means a significant segment of the working‑age population **does not benefit directly** from wage growth, and must rely more heavily on benefits.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Finland 2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross monthly wage (EUR)

Approximate brackets for full‑time workers:

- **< €2,100/month**
  → Usually **low‑wage or part‑time**, often near the lowest pay grades. Tight or precarious, especially in big cities.

- **€2,100–€3,500/month**
  → **Lower‑middle**: many early‑career, administrative, retail or basic technical roles.

- **€3,500–€5,000/month**
  → **Core middle**: around / above the median; common for experienced professionals, teachers, nurses, many office workers.

- **€5,000–€7,000/month**
  → **Upper‑middle**: typical of senior professionals in IT, engineering, finance; some managers and specialists.

- **> €7,000/month**
  → **High‑income**: senior management, top specialists, well‑paid tech or finance roles.

### 5.2 Household net monthly income (2‑person household)

Using **€2,500/month per consumption unit** as a median benchmark:

- **< €3,000/month**
  → Often **low‑income or near‑poverty**, especially for renters in metropolitan areas.

- **€3,000–€4,500/month**
  → **Lower‑middle**: basics covered but limited savings; vulnerable to unemployment or health shocks.

- **€4,500–€6,500/month**
  → **Broad middle class**: can handle typical housing, transport and some saving; standard for dual median‑earner households.

- **> €6,500/month**
  → **Upper‑middle to affluent**: strong financial resilience and discretionary spending.

## 6. Short “Finland 2025” Snapshot

By **2025**, **Finland** is a **high‑income, relatively egalitarian economy** with **nominal GDP per head around \$56,000** and **PPP GDP per head around \$66,500**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **€3,611/month gross** (≈ **\$49,000/year**), while the **average wage** is higher at **€4,070/month**, and **collective‑agreement floors** keep most full‑time wages above **€2,100–2,500/month**. After taxes and transfers, the **median adult‑equivalent disposable income is about €2,500/month**, and a typical **2‑person household** needs **roughly €2,250/month** to avoid poverty and **€4,500–6,000/month** to be securely middle‑class. Income inequality is **low (Gini ≈ 0.28)**, but **around 12–13 %** of Finns are **income‑poor** and **~17 %** at risk of poverty or social exclusion, especially single‑parent families and the long‑term unemployed. With **real GDP growing around 1.3 %**, **inflation near 2 %**, and **unemployment close to 10 %**, Finland combines **very high output and solid social protection** with **weak labour‑market conditions and slow median income growth**, making the gap between strong macro averages and the lived experience of lower‑ and lower‑middle‑income households a central policy issue.
