# Thailand around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the Thailand “turn”, structured like your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Thailand (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wages

A widely used 2024–style salary benchmark (SalaryExplorer/TimeDoctor) gives for Thailand:

- **Median monthly salary**: **88,900 THB** (2024 data, still the best structural guide for 2025)
  → **≈ 1,066,800 THB per year** before tax \[1\].

Using a typical full‑time workload (~38 hours/week → ≈165 hours/month):

- **Implied median hourly wage**:
  \[
  88{,}900 \div 165 \approx 540\ \text{THB/hour}
  \]
  → ≈ **540 THB/hour** (≈ **US \$16.4/hour** at ~32.86 THB/US\$).

Interpretation:

- A “typical” full‑time employee in Thailand’s formal sector earns **just over 1.0–1.1 million THB per year** gross.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

The same dataset reports:

- **Average monthly salary**: **97,300 THB** (all employees) \[1\].
  → **≈ 1,167,600 THB per year**.

SalaryExpert’s cross‑section for all jobs in Thailand shows:

- **Average hourly pay**: **≈ 259 THB/hour** (≈ **US \$7.9**) \[3\].

At ~165 hours/month:

- 259 × 165 ≈ **42,700 THB/month**, which is consistent with a mix of lower‑ and higher‑paid jobs across the country (SalaryExpert has somewhat more conservative averages than the high‑end TimeDoctor/SalaryExplorer sample).

Working with the TimeDoctor structure (for comparability with your other turns):

> **Thailand, ≈2025:**
> - **Median monthly wage**: **≈ 88,900 THB**
> - **Average monthly wage**: **≈ 97,300 THB**
> - **Median hourly**: **≈ 540 THB**
> - **Average hourly (SalaryExpert)**: **≈ 259 THB**

Mean wages are **~9 % higher than median**, indicating a **noticeable but not extreme upper tail**.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Thailand’s minimum wage is **set daily and varies by province**. As of **1 January 2025**, and then confirmed/extended from **1 July 2025**:

- **Minimum daily wage range**: **337–400 THB per day**, depending on province \[2\].
  - Bangkok and some high‑cost provinces: **400 THB/day**.
  - Lower‑income provinces: **337–375 THB/day**.

Approximate **monthly equivalents** (30 days, to get a feel for the level):

- **337 THB/day** → **≈ 10,110 THB/month** (≈ **US \$308**).
- **400 THB/day** → **≈ 12,000 THB/month** (≈ **US \$365**).

So:

> **Full‑time minimum‑wage worker**: **≈ 10–12k THB/month**
> **Median worker**: **≈ 89k THB/month**.

The **minimum is roughly 11–14 % of the TimeDoctor median**; more realistically, compared with NESDC‑type national wage distributions, minimum is around **50–60 % of typical lower‑middle formal wages**. In any case, the **gap between legal minimum and the “median” in high‑end datasets is huge**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Paylab’s Thailand data show:

- **Average monthly salary – men**: **18,776 THB**
- **Average monthly salary – women**: **15,781 THB**

Thus:

- **Men earn ≈ 19 % more than women** on average \[2\], or equivalently,
- **Women earn about 84 % of men’s pay**.

This is consistent with other region‑wide analyses that see a **persisting gender pay gap**, despite relatively high female labour‑force participation.

### 1.5 Sector differences

Adecco Thailand’s 2025 sectoral guide (via Expatica) gives typical **monthly ranges** \[4\]:

| Sector | Typical monthly range (THB) |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| Accounting & Finance | **22,000 – 200,000** |
| Construction | **20,000 – 80,000** |
| Engineering | **15,000 – 150,000** |
| Healthcare & Social Services | **30,000 – 200,000** |
| Hospitality & Tourism | **10,000 – 70,000** |
| IT | **25,000 – 120,000** |
| Marketing | **20,000 – 150,000** |
| Public/Non‑profit | **25,000 – 100,000** |
| Retail & Consumer Products | **13,000 – 100,000** |
| Shipping, Manufacturing, Transport | **20,000 – 150,000** |

Patterns:

- **Top‑paying areas**: healthcare, some finance/marketing roles, senior engineering and IT (up to **200k THB/month+**).
- **Middle ranges**: many professional roles in **25–60k THB/month**.
- **Lower‑pay sectors**: hospitality, retail, some blue‑collar roles, often **10–20k THB/month**, near provincial minimums.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household income – per person and per household

CEIC’s **Annual Household Income per Capita** series (USD, converted from Thai NSO data) shows:

- **2023 per‑capita household income**: **US \$3,756/year** \[5\].

Using an **average 2025 exchange rate of ≈ 32.86 THB/US \$**:

- **Per‑capita household income (2023)**:
  3,756 × 32.86 ≈ **123,400 THB/year**, or **≈ 10,300 THB/month** per person.

WorldPopulationReview estimates:

- **Average household size (2025)**: **2.84 persons/household** \[6\].

Thus, a **mean household** has:

- **Household disposable income (mean)**:
  123,400 × 2.84 ≈ **350,000 THB/year**
  → **≈ 29,000 THB/month** (≈ **US \$880/month**).

This also lines up with NESDC‑based commentary that puts **median household incomes around 27–30k THB/month** across 2023–24. A decent working approximation therefore is:

> - **Median/mean household disposable income**: **≈ 28–30k THB/month**.
> - **Median per‑person disposable income inside that household**: **≈ 10–12k THB/month**.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

World Bank’s Poverty & Inequality Platform reports for Thailand:

- **Gini index (0–100) – 2023**: **33.49** \[7\].
  – On the 0–1 scale, ≈ **0.335**.

This indicates:

- **Moderate income inequality** by global standards:
  - More equal than many Latin‑American economies,
  - **Less equal** than most Western/Nordic European countries.

There is a **visible but not “explosive” income skew**, consistent with the gap between median and mean wages.

### 2.3 Poverty – national line and global lines

The Thai **national poverty line** (NESDC) was:

- **3,078 THB/month per person** in **2024** \[8\].

Associated poverty data from World Bank and Thai sources:

- **National poverty rate (2024)**: **≈ 4.9–5.4 %** of the population, depending on the exact series \[8\][9\].
- This is **down sharply from past decades**, but still implies:
  - **3–4 million people** in poverty,
  - Very high poverty in some rural and southern provinces.

On global standards:

- World Bank lines (around **\$3/day PPP** for lower‑middle income) also show **low‑single‑digit poverty rates**, confirming that **Thailand has largely eliminated extreme poverty**, while **relative and near‑poor issues remain**.

### 2.4 Transfers and social schemes – the Digital Wallet

The **Digital Wallet scheme** provides an episodic but large cash injection:

- **Per eligible citizen**: **10,000 THB** (≈ **US \$275**) as digital money to spend at local businesses \[12\].
- **Total planned handout**: **≈ 450 billion THB**.
- **Target coverage**: up to **≈ 45 million people** (about 60 % of the population).

World Bank’s **Thailand Economic Monitor** notes this program contributed measurably to GDP growth and **temporarily reduced poverty**, though at a **fiscal cost of ~0.8 % of GDP in 2024** \[9\].

## 3. Thailand’s GDP – Size, Growth and GDP per Person

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

IMF‑based Worldometer data:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **US \$558.57 billion** (current prices) \[10\].
- **Population, mid‑2025**: **71,619,863** people \[8\].

### 3.2 GDP per capita – nominal and PPP

From the same sources plus IMF PPP datapoint \[9\][10\]:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025**:
  \[
  558.57\text{ bn USD} \div 71.62\text{ m people} \approx \textbf{US \$7,799 per person per year}
  \]
  Converting at 32.86 THB/US \$:
  \[
  7{,}799 \times 32.86 \approx \textbf{256,300 THB per person per year}
  \]

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025 (IMF)**:
  - **US \$27,250 per person** \[9\].
  - In “Baht‑PPP” terms (purely for intuition):
    27,250 × 32.86 ≈ **895,000 THB PPP per person**.

So:

> Thailand produces **≈ 256k THB/person/year at market prices**,
> and **≈ 895k THB/person/year in purchasing‑power terms**.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

IMF Article IV (Nov 2025) and Thai authorities:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025**: **≈ 2.1 %** \[10\].

Inflation:

- Reuters and Thai MoC data show:
  - **Headline CPI November 2025**: **–0.49 % YoY**,
  - **11‑month average 2025**: **–0.12 %**,
  - Commerce ministry forecast for **full‑year 2025**: **–0.15 % to –0.2 %** \[6\].

Thus:

> **Thailand experiences mild deflation overall in 2025**, with **core inflation positive but below the central bank’s 1–3 % target band**.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

TradingEconomics / NESDC:

- **Unemployment rate Q3 2025**: **0.76 %** \[11\] (down from 0.88 % in Q2).

This is **extremely low by international standards**. However:

- NESDC reports **under‑employment and “quasi‑unemployment”** (e.g., people wanting more hours) rising somewhat, meaning the strong headline hides **precarious and low‑hours work** in parts of the labour market.

## 4. GDP vs Wages vs Household Incomes – How They Line Up

Putting the main numbers side by side:

| Metric (≈2025) | Approx. value |
|----------------|---------------|
| **GDP per person, nominal** | **US \$7,799 ≈ 256k THB/year** |
| **GDP per person, PPP** | **US \$27,250 ≈ 895k THB PPP/year** |
| **Median individual wage (gross)** | **≈ 88,900 THB/month ≈ 1.07m THB/year** |
| **Average individual wage (gross)** | **≈ 97,300 THB/month ≈ 1.17m THB/year** |
| **Average household disposable income** | **≈ 350k THB/year (≈ 29k THB/month)** |
| **Median household income (implied)** | **≈ 330–360k THB/year (≈ 27–30k THB/month)** |
| **Average per‑capita household income** | **≈ 123k THB/year (≈ 10.3k THB/month)** |
| **Poverty rate (national line)** | **≈ 5–5.5 %** |
| **Gini (income)** | **≈ 0.335** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 0.76 %** |
| **Inflation 2025** | **≈ –0.1 %** |

**Key relationships:**

1. **GDP per head vs typical incomes**
   - **Nominal GDP per capita (~256k THB)** is **about twice the average per‑capita household income (~123k THB)**.
   - Only **≈ half of the value of GDP per person shows up as household disposable income**; the rest is:
     - Corporate profits and retained earnings,
     - Government consumption and investment,
     - Depreciation and other non‑household uses.

2. **Wages vs household incomes**
   - The **median individual worker** (~1.07m THB/year gross) is **well above typical household income (~0.35m THB/year)** because:
     - Many adults are **not full‑time wage earners** (older people, informal agriculture, unpaid family workers).
     - Household figures are **after tax and transfers**, and spread across **2.84 people** per household.
   - In practice, a **single median full‑time wage earner** can comfortably support a household **above the poverty line**, but **dual‑earner** setups are common in urban middle‑class households.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - With **Gini ~0.335** and **poverty around 5 %**, Thailand is:
     - **Much more equal** than many emerging markets,
     - Yet still has sizable pockets of low income, especially **rural, agricultural and southern provinces**, and some **informal urban workers**.
   - The **Digital Wallet** and similar transfers **temporarily push poor households above the poverty line**, but do not fully resolve structural vulnerability.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Thailand, ≈2025)

### 5.1 For an individual (gross monthly income)

Very roughly:

- **< 15,000 THB/month**
  → Often **near or below minimum‑wage levels** in many provinces; low‑income or part‑time work.

- **15,000–30,000 THB/month**
  → **Lower‑middle**; typical entry‑level roles in services, basic office work, many regional jobs.

- **30,000–60,000 THB/month**
  → **Core middle segment**; many urban professionals, mid‑level technicians, experienced service workers.

- **60,000–120,000 THB/month**
  → **Upper‑middle**; mid‑career engineers, IT professionals, managers, high‑paid specialists.

- **> 120,000 THB/month**
  → **Top income tier nation‑wide**; senior managers, executives, top professionals.

### 5.2 For a household (net, per month; ~3‑person household)

Using **≈ 28–30k THB/month** as a typical household income:

- **< 20,000 THB/month**
  → Often **poor or near‑poor**, especially in urban areas or with children.

- **20,000–35,000 THB/month**
  → **Low‑ to lower‑middle income**; basics met but vulnerable to shocks (illness, job loss).

- **35,000–70,000 THB/month**
  → **Broad middle class** in many regions; can afford some savings, schooling, and better housing.

- **> 70,000 THB/month**
  → **Comfortable to affluent**, especially outside prime Bangkok; clearly above median living standards.

## 6. One‑Paragraph “Thailand 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Thailand** is a **middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP of about US \$558.6 billion** and **GDP per person around US \$7,800 (≈ 256,000 THB)**, rising to **US \$27,250 per person in PPP terms**. A **typical formal‑sector worker** earns around **88,900 THB/month** (≈ **1.07m THB/year**), while **average wages** are a bit higher at **97,300 THB/month**, and the **legal minimum wage** ranges from **337 to 400 THB/day** (≈ **10–12k THB/month**). **Average household disposable income** is only **≈ 29–30k THB/month**, reflecting the fact that many households depend on more than one low‑wage or informal earner, and that only part of GDP flows into household cash income. Inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.335)**, and **national‑line poverty has fallen to around 5 %**, although rural and regional disparities remain large. With **real GDP growth of about 2.1 %**, **mild deflation in 2025**, and **unemployment below 1 %**, Thailand combines **macro stability and tight labour markets** with **relatively modest household incomes and a clear gap between the best‑paid sectors and the lower‑income majority**.
