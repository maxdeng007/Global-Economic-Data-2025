# Netherlands around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Netherlands “turn”**, structured to match the other country profiles you already have.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in the Netherlands (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wages

There is no single official CBS “median wage” table, but combining Dutch and EU sources gives a coherent picture:

- **Median gross annual salary (all workers, 2025)**:
  – **≈ €46,500 / year**, i.e. **≈ €3,875 / month** gross [1].
- The **Centraal Planbureau (CPB)** projects a very similar **median gross salary of €48,000 in 2026**, which implies **mid‑€40k–high‑€40k** as the central **2024–25** range.

Using typical full‑time hours:

- CBS reports average full‑time working hours around **1,791 hours/year** in 2024 (a little over 34 hours/week) [2].
- If we spread **€46,500** over **1,791 hours**, we get a **median‑type hourly wage** of roughly:

\[
\frac{€46{,}500}{1{,}791} \approx €26\text{/hour}
\]

So a realistic **“typical worker” benchmark** for 2025 is:

> **Median‑type full‑time salary (Netherlands, 2025):**
> **≈ €45,000–€50,000 per year gross**
> → **≈ €3,700–€4,100 per month**
> → **≈ €25–27 per hour**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Several consistent sources show the mean wage is **above** this median:

- CBS StatLine “jobs, wages, working hours” finds for **2024**:
  – **Average gross monthly wage (including overtime):** **€3,249** for all jobs, including part‑time and lower‑pay sectors [3].

- Macroeconomic and survey‑based estimates for 2025 give a higher figure, reflecting ongoing wage growth:
  - **TradingEconomics – Gross Monthly Income**:
    – **2024:** **€3,708 / month**
    – **2025:** **€3,875 / month** [4].
  - Multiple 2025 salary guides converge on:
    - **Average gross monthly salary:** **≈ €3,800–3,900**
    - → **≈ €45,000–47,000 per year** [5][6][7].

Taking these together:

> **Average (mean) gross wage, 2025:**
> **≈ €3,800–3,900 per month** → **≈ €45,000–47,000 per year**.

Because the distribution is skewed (high earners at the top), **mean > median**, but they are in the same broad range (mid‑€40k).

### 1.3 Minimum wage

The Netherlands has a **national statutory minimum hourly wage**, adjusted every six months:

- **From 1 January 2025 (age 21+):** **€14.06 / hour** [8].
- **From 1 July 2025 (age 21+):** **€14.40 / hour** [9].

For a typical **40‑hour week**, that implies:

- **Monthly minimum wage (Jan 2025):**
  – 40 h × €14.06 × 52 / 12 ≈ **€2,440 / month**.
- **Monthly minimum wage (Jul 2025):**
  – 40 h × €14.40 × 52 / 12 ≈ **€2,500 / month**.

So a **full‑time minimum‑wage worker** earns roughly:

> **≈ €28,000–30,000 per year gross**.

Relative to the earlier benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median full‑time wage**: about **60–65 %** of median.
- **Minimum vs mean wage**: about **55–60 %** of the average full‑time wage.

This defines a sizeable **low‑wage segment**, especially in retail, hospitality and some services.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

CBS analysis of 2024 wages shows:

- **Average hourly wage for men:** **€30.32**
- **Average hourly wage for women:** **€27.15**

Women therefore earn:

\[
\frac{27.15}{30.32} \approx 0.895
\]

→ About **10.5 % less per hour** than men on average [10][11].

The gap:

- Was around **19 % in 2010**,
- Has **almost halved**, but still indicates substantial inequality, especially in higher positions and sectors with fewer women.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage differences (broad)

Using CBS wage data and 2025 salary guides:

- **High‑pay sectors:**
  - **Finance, insurance, real estate, IT, specialised professional services**
    – Many roles: **€4,500–7,000 / month**, senior or specialised roles far above.

- **Mid‑range sectors:**
  - **Industry, construction, logistics, healthcare, education (higher levels)**
    – Many roles: **€3,000–4,500 / month**.

- **Low‑pay sectors:**
  - **Retail, hospitality, basic care and cleaning**
    – Often **€2,300–3,000 / month**, clustered around the minimum wage.

**Regionally**:

- **Randstad (Amsterdam/Rotterdam/The Hague/Utrecht)**:
  – Wages typically **10–15 % above national averages** for similar roles.
- **Northern/Eastern provinces (e.g. Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel)**:
  – Wages often **a few percentage points below** national average, but with lower housing costs.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income (net, after tax)

CBS’s “Welfare of households; key figures” (2023, latest full year) provides:

- **Median disposable household income, 2023:** **€34,000 / year** (net) [12].
- **Mean disposable household income, 2023:** **€38,300 / year** [12].

These are **per household** and **already after income tax and social contributions**.

Given:

- **Strong wage growth** in 2023–24 (negotiated wages +6.1 % in 2023 and +6.6 % in 2024) [13],
- Real disposable income rising **≈ 5.4 % in 2023–24** and another **2–3 % in 2025** [14][15],

it is reasonable to scale these 2023 net figures up modestly.

A plausible **2025 household perspective**:

> - **Median net household income (2025):** **≈ €36,000–38,000 / year** (≈ €3,000–3,200 / month).
> - **Mean net household income (2025):** **≈ €41,000–43,000 / year**.

Given **average household size ≈ 2.4 people**, the **median per‑person net income** is around:

\[
\frac{€37{,}000}{2.4} \approx €15{,}400\ \text{per person per year} \approx €1{,}280\ \text{per month}
\]

For international comparison, Statista and various cross‑country compilers estimate:

- **Household disposable income per capita (PPP, 2025):**
  – **≈ \$36,700 / person** (market forecast) [16], and
  – **≈ \$49,800 / person** in **real PPP terms** (2025 ranking) [17].

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Eurostat and CBS show:

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income (2024):** **25.9 %** [18].
- A related OECD measure (Gini 0–1 scale) for 2022 put the Netherlands at **0.288**, with the EU average at **0.316** [19].

Interpretation:

- The Netherlands is among the **most equal high‑income countries** in income terms:
  – **More equal** than Germany, France, and the EU average,
  – Inferior only to a handful of very egalitarian systems (Czechia, Slovenia, some Nordics).

However, wealth inequality is **much higher**, with top deciles owning a large majority of assets, but your focus is on income.

### 2.3 Poverty – absolute vs relative

CBS’s **“Life in Poverty 2025”** and related releases show:

- **Absolute poverty (national standard):**
  - **2024:** **551,000 people** in poverty
  - → **3.1 % of the population** (up from 2.7 % in 2023) [20].

This uses a **national basic‑needs budget** (food, housing, clothing, essential expenses).

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (EU 60 % median threshold):**
  - **2024 (Eurostat)**: **12.1 %** of people had income **below 60 % of the national median equivalised income** [21].

So:

> - **About 3 %** face **absolute poverty** by Dutch national standards.
> - **About 12 %** are **“at risk of poverty”** in the EU’s relative sense.

Children and single‑parent households are more affected:

- **Children (absolute poverty, CBS):** **2.8 %** in 2024 [20].
- **Young adults (18–24) at‑risk‑of‑poverty (Eurostat):** **23.2 %** [22].

Poverty is markedly **higher among non‑Dutch nationals, single‑parent families and renters**.

## 3. Netherlands’ GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

IMF‑based data (Worldometer):

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:** **≈ \$1.34 trillion** [23].
- **Population, mid‑2025:** **≈ 18,346,819** people [24].

So:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \approx \frac{\$1.34\text{T}}{18.35\text{M}} \approx \$73{,}174\text{/person/year} [23]
\]

At an average 2025 FX rate (~0.86 €/\$):

- **≈ €63,000 / person per year** at market prices.

### 3.2 PPP GDP and PPP GDP per person

World Bank and TradingEconomics:

- **PPP GDP per capita (2024)**: **≈ \$70,902** [25].
- Forecasts for 2025–26: **≈ \$71–72k** per person (PPP) [25][26].

So in PPP terms, the Netherlands produces roughly:

> **\$71–72k per person per year**,
> which is **above most EU countries** and close to the **top 10–15 worldwide**.

### 3.3 Real GDP growth and inflation

From the European Commission’s **Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast**, CPB and CBS:

- **Real GDP growth (2025):**
  - **IMF/Worldometer:** **1.4 %** [27].
  - **European Commission:** **1.7 %** [13].
  - **CPB projections:** **~1.9 %** [28].

A reasonable central estimate is:

> **Real GDP growth 2025:** **≈ 1.5–1.8 %**.

- **Inflation (CPI, YoY – November 2025, CBS flash estimate):** **2.9 %** [29].
- **HICP (harmonised) YoY – November 2025:** **2.6 %** [29].
- Full‑year 2025 inflation is around **3.0–3.3 %**, down sharply from the 2022 energy‑crisis spike.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

CBS monthly labour‑force statistics:

- **Unemployment rate, October 2025:** **4.0 %** (ILO, ages 15–74) [30].
- **Unemployment, November 2025:**
  – **408,000 people**, **4.0 % of the labour force**, the highest in 4 years but still low by EU standards [31].
- Throughout 2025, unemployment fluctuated between **3.7–4.0 %**, according to CBS and NL Times summaries.

The **labour market remains tight**, with vacancies still high relative to the number of unemployed, even though the extreme post‑pandemic tightness has eased.

### 3.5 Labour productivity

- CBS: **Labour productivity (GDP per hour worked)** **fell by 0.2 % in 2024**, after a **1.3 % fall in 2023**; productivity stagnated in the 2020s [32].
- International comparisons (ILO, OECD, Wikipedia compendium) show:

  - **Netherlands – GDP per working hour, 2025:** **92.3 international dollars per hour (PPP, 2021 base)** [33].
  - This is **well above the OECD and EU averages**, placing the Netherlands among **Europe’s most productive economies per hour worked**.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

Putting the main numbers side by side (≈2025):

| Metric | Approximate level |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per person** | **\$73,174** (≈ €63k) |
| **PPP GDP per person** | **\$71–72k (PPP)** |
| **Median gross salary (individual)** | **≈ €46–50k/year** |
| **Average gross salary (individual)** | **≈ €45–47k/year** (all employees; full‑time averages higher) |
| **Median net household income** | **≈ €36–38k/year** |
| **Median per‑person net income** | **≈ €15–16k/year** (≈ €1,300/month) |
| **Mean per‑capita disposable income (PPP)** | **≈ \$36.7k–49.8k/year** depending on method [16][17] |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | **25.9 %** |
| **Absolute poverty (national)** | **3.1 % of population** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (EU 60 % median)** | **12.1 % of population** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 4.0 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 3.0 %** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 1.5–1.8 %** |

**Key relationships:**

1. **GDP per head vs individual incomes**
   - **Nominal GDP per person (~€63k)** is higher than the **average gross wage (~€45–47k)** and much higher than **median per‑person disposable income (~€15–16k)**.
   - Only a **share of GDP** turns into **household cash income**; the rest is:
     - Corporate profits and retained earnings,
     - Taxes and social contributions,
     - Government consumption (education, health, defence),
     - Depreciation and net exports.

2. **Wages vs household incomes**
   - A single individual earning the **median wage (~€47k)** typically nets **~€30–34k/year** after tax and social contributions.
   - For a **2.4‑person household**, this becomes **~€13–14k per person**, close to the **median per‑person disposable income**.
   - Dual‑earner households and households with substantial non‑labour income sit well above median, contributing to the higher **mean household income**.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - Despite a **very low Gini** and broad middle‑class, **around 1 in 8 residents (12.1 %)** are **below 60 % of the median income** – i.e. relatively poor.
   - **Absolute poverty (3.1 %)** is small but rising again after years of decline, driven by cost‑of‑living pressures on low‑income households.

4. **Productivity vs real wage growth**
   - Labour productivity per hour is **very high**, but **growth has stagnated** (small declines in 2023–24).
   - Meanwhile, **nominal wages have risen 5–7 %/year** recently and, with inflation back near 3 %, **real wages and real household incomes have started to increase again**, improving purchasing power for most.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (for Self‑Assessment and Comparison)

### 5.1 For an individual worker (gross per year)

Approximate **2025 salary brackets**:

- **< €30,000 / year**
  – Typically low‑paid jobs or significant part‑time work; limited financial buffer.
- **€30,000–€40,000 / year**
  – **Lower‑middle**: many junior admin, retail supervisors, basic technical roles.
- **€40,000–€55,000 / year**
  – Around or slightly above the **median**; standard for many professionals, nurses, teachers, technical staff.
- **€55,000–€80,000 / year**
  – **Upper‑middle**; common for experienced professionals, senior teachers, mid‑level managers.
- **> €80,000 / year**
  – **High income** in Dutch terms, especially outside expensive cities; common in senior management, finance, IT, consulting.

### 5.2 For a household (net disposable per year)

For a **2–3 person household**:

- **< €25,000 / year net**
  – Likely below the **EU at‑risk‑of‑poverty line**, particularly for families with children.
- **€25,000–€40,000 / year net**
  – **Lower‑income**: basics covered, but housing and energy costs can be constraining.
- **€40,000–€60,000 / year net**
  – **Broad middle class**: adequate standard of living, some capacity to save.
- **€60,000–€90,000 / year net**
  – **Comfortable middle to upper‑middle**, especially outside Amsterdam’s most expensive districts.
- **> €90,000 / year net**
  – **Affluent** relative to the median; strong savings/investment potential.

## 6. Short “Netherlands 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, the **Netherlands** is a **high‑income, highly productive economy** with **nominal GDP of about \$1.34 trillion** and **GDP per person around \$73,000 (≈ €63,000)**, and PPP GDP per head of roughly **\$71–72,000**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **€45–50k gross per year** (≈ €3.7–4.1k/month), while the **average wage** is in the **mid‑€40k range**, and the **statutory minimum wage** guarantees around **€28–30k/year** for full‑timers aged 21+. After taxes and transfers, the **median household** lives on about **€36–38k/year**, and the **median person** on roughly **€15–16k/year**. **Income inequality is low** (Gini ≈ 25.9 %), but **about 12 %** of people remain **at risk of poverty** under the EU definition and **3.1 %** live in **absolute poverty** by Dutch standards, with higher risks for young adults, single parents and some migrant groups. **Unemployment** has risen to **around 4 %** but the labour market is still relatively tight; **inflation has fallen back towards 3 %**, while real wages and real household incomes are rising again. Overall, the Netherlands combines **very high GDP per head and high labour productivity** with **moderate but non‑trivial pockets of relative poverty**, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution and in specific demographic groups.
