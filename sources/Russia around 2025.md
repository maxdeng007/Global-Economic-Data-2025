# Russia around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Russia “turn”** in the same style as your UK / China / Japan / EU / US / Canada / Australia / India / Ukraine profiles:
**wages → household incomes & inequality → GDP & GDP per head → how they fit together and practical benchmarks.**

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Russia (2024–2025)

### 1.1 “Typical” (median‑type) wage

Rosstat‑based work on the wage distribution gives a **median monthly wage** of:

- **Median monthly salary – January 2023:** **43,500 RUB** (≈ **\$520** at an exchange rate ~83.8 RUB/US\$) [1].

Nominal wages grew strongly in 2023–24 (average wages up nearly 20 % in 2024 relative to 2023), and again through 2025 [3][9][23]. A **reasonable 2025‑era median‑type worker wage** is therefore:

> **≈ 46,000 RUB per month**,
> → **≈ 552,000 RUB per year** (≈ **\$6,600/year**, before income tax and social contributions).

If we assume ~174 paid hours/month:

- **Implied median hourly wage:**
  46,000 ÷ 174 ≈ **265 RUB/hour** ≈ **\$3.2/hour**.

This is a **mid‑point**: **half of workers earn less than roughly 45–50k RUB/month, half earn more.**

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Official monthly‐earnings data (Rosstat via TradingEconomics) show:

- **Average monthly wage (Oct 2025):** **99,707 RUB** [9].

Using this:

- **Mean annual wage (all employees):**
  99,707 × 12 ≈ **1.20 million RUB/year**
  → at ≈83.8 RUB/US\$, around **\$14,300/year**.

Independent salary surveys (e.g. TimeDoctor) give a compatible **average hourly wage**:

- **Average hourly wage:** **600 RUB/hour** ≈ **\$7.15/hour** (2023 basis) [10].

At 173–174 hours/month this also yields **~104,000 RUB/month**, in line with the 99–104k Rosstat estimate.

So, rounded:

> **Average wage (all employees, 2025):**
> **≈ 100,000 RUB/month** (≈ \$1,200) → **≈ 1.2 million RUB/year** (≈ \$14–15k).

The **average is more than double the median**, signalling a **highly skewed wage distribution**: a relatively small upper tier of earners pulls up the mean.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Russia has a federal statutory minimum wage:

- **National minimum wage (from 1 Jan 2025):** **22,440 RUB/month** (≈ **\$268/month**) [11].
- For a 40‑hour week, this corresponds to **≈ 140 RUB/hour**.

Relative to other benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median wage:** ~**22.4k / 46k ≈ 50 %**.
- **Minimum vs mean wage:** ~**22.4k / 100k ≈ 22–23 %**.

So a minimum‑wage worker earns **about half of a “typical” worker’s pay** and **around a fifth of the average worker’s pay**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

West‑based analysis of Russian official data finds that:

- **Unadjusted gender pay gap (2023):** **49.1 %** – men earn **about 49 % more than women on average** [12].

The gap widened from **47 % (2021)** to **49.1 % (2023)** and is among the **largest in the G20**.

### 1.5 Sector differences (broad picture)

- **Top‑pay sectors** (typical averages often ≥ 120k RUB/month):
  - **Oil & gas and other extractives** – long among Russia’s highest‑paying employers, with many rotational/offshore roles above 150–200k RUB/month [3][25].
  - **Finance and IT** – white‑collar salaries often in the **90–150k RUB/month** range.

- **Middle‑pay sectors**:
  - **Manufacturing & construction** – official data suggest sectoral averages around **70–90k RUB/month** [3][26].

- **Lower‑pay sectors**:
  - **Education, retail, hospitality, low‑skill services** – many roles sit around **30–50k RUB/month**.

Overall, **sector and regional gaps are huge**: a skilled oil‑and‑gas worker in the Far North may earn **three to four times** what a teacher or shop worker in poorer regions earns.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Per‑person income: average vs median

Two complementary Rosstat‑based analyses illustrate the distribution:

- **Average per‑capita cash income (mid‑2024):**
  – **33,800 RUB/month** [13].
  – ≈ **405,600 RUB/year** (≈ **\$4,800/year** at 83.8 RUB/US\$).

- **Median per‑capita income (2023):**
  – **≈ 40,000 RUB/month**, per Rosstat estimates summarised by re‑Russia [17].

Interpretation:

- A **typical person** in the mid‑2020s lives on **≈ 34–40k RUB per month** of cash income.
- That is **far below** the average disposable‑income figures implied by PPP comparisons (see below), indicating that a **small wealthy minority** pushes up aggregate means.

### 2.2 Household disposable income per person

A Statista forecast for **household disposable income per capita** in Russia (2025) indicates relatively high levels in PPP terms, with per‑capita disposable resources in the **tens of thousands of US\$/year** range in purchasing‑power terms [14].

Combined with the per‑capita income data above, a **realistic mid‑2020s picture** is:

- **Median per‑person cash income (nominal):**
  – ≈ **35–40k RUB/month** (≈ \$420–480).
- **Mean per‑person disposable income (PPP):**
  – perhaps **2–3× higher** in PPP terms.

The key is that **PPP‑level averages mask a very skewed distribution**: many Russians have **much less** spending power than aggregate PPP figures suggest.

### 2.3 Household size

Russia’s **average household size** in recent data is around **2.6 persons** [15].

So for the **median‑type household**:

- **Median household cash income (rough order of magnitude):**
  2.6 × 35–40k ≈ **90–100k RUB/month** (≈ \$1,100–1,200/month).

This is close to the **average wage of one worker**; many households rely on **a single earner**, especially outside large cities.

### 2.4 Poverty – official view

From Rosstat data summarised in 2025 reports:

- **Poverty line (per person, 2024):** **15,552 RUB/month** (≈ **\$185/month**) [16].
- **Official poverty rate, Q1 2025:** **8.1 %** of the population, or **≈ 11.9 million people** [7].

The poverty threshold is roughly:

- **~45 % of the median per‑capita income**, and
- **~35 % of the typical full‑time worker’s net wage**, highlighting that **single‑earner households with dependants can fall below the line even when the earner is above the individual median.**

Critics point out that the **methodology was changed in 2021**, lowering the measured rate, and that **subjective living‑standard surveys** show a much larger group living on the edge of hardship [17].

### 2.5 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Statista’s **socio‑economic indicators** forecast the **Gini coefficient** for Russia at:

- **Gini 2025 (forecast): 0.36** [18].

This implies:

- More inequality than **most EU countries** (typically **0.27–0.32**).
- Less inequality than **the US** (≈ **0.48–0.49**).
- Combined with the wage data (mean ≈ 2× median), it confirms a **highly skewed distribution**: relatively modest poverty by official thresholds, but a big gap between the **top 10–20 %** and the **lower half**.

## 3. Russia’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP

From IMF‑based compilations (Worldometers) and the Russia macro profile:

- **Nominal GDP (2025):** **\$2.54 trillion** [19].
- **Population (2025):** ≈ **144 million** [19].

Then:

- **Nominal GDP per capita (2025):**
  – **\$17,446 per person per year** [19].
- **PPP GDP per capita (2025):**
  – **\$49,049 per person per year (PPP)** [19].

So in simple terms:

> Russia produces roughly **\$17.5k of output per person at market prices**, but in local purchasing‑power terms that feels like **≈ \$49k per person**.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth

- **Real GDP growth (2025):** **≈ 1 %** [20].

This is a **sharp slowdown** from the high defense‑driven post‑2022 rebound (growth of around 4 % in 2023–24), as war‑related spending and sanctions constraints bite.

### 3.3 Inflation

CPI figures for late 2025 show:

- **Inflation, Nov 2025 (YoY):** **6.6 %**;
  – down from **7.7 %** in October,
  – the lowest since Sept 2023 [21].

Bank of Russia commentary suggested inflation would be **“below 6 %” by end‑2025** [21].

### 3.4 Labour market

Rosstat/TradingEconomics unemployment:

- **Unemployment rate, Nov 2025:** **2.1 %** (record low) [22].
- Earlier in 2025 it hovered around **2.2–2.3 %**; long‑run average (since 1990s) ≈ **6.7 %** [22].

Real wage indicators:

- **Real wage growth, Oct 2025 (YoY):** **6.1 %** [23].
- **Real disposable incomes, Q3 2025 (YoY):** **+8.5 %**, and **+9.2 %** for Jan–Sept combined [24].

So:

> The **labour market is extremely tight** by Russian standards – unemployment ≈ 2 %, real wages and real incomes rising **5–9 %** – even as overall **GDP growth slips to ≈ 1 %**.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

Putting the core numbers side‑by‑side:

| Metric (approx, 2025) | Value |
|------------------------|-------|
| **GDP per person (nominal)** | **\$17.5k/year** |
| **GDP per person (PPP)** | **\$49.0k/year (PPP)** |
| **Average wage (all employees)** | **≈ 100k RUB/month ≈ \$14.3k/year** |
| **Typical (median‑type) full‑time wage** | **≈ 46k RUB/month ≈ \$6.6k/year** |
| **Median per‑capita cash income** | **≈ 35–40k RUB/month ≈ \$4.8k/year** |
| **Official poverty rate** | **8.1 % of population** |
| **Poverty line** | **15,552 RUB/month per person** |
| **Gini coefficient** | **≈ 0.36** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 2.1 %** |
| **Inflation (YoY, late 2025)** | **~6.6 %** |

**Relationships**

1. **GDP per capita (\$17.5k)** vs **typical personal income (\$4.8–6.6k)**
   - A **typical worker’s pay** and **typical person’s cash income** are far below **GDP per head**.
   - The gap captures:
     - **Corporate profits and reinvested earnings** (especially in energy/commodities),
     - **Taxes and social contributions**,
     - **Government consumption and capital formation**,
     - **Depreciation and war losses**.

2. **Mean vs median wage**
   - Average wage (~100k RUB/month) is more than **double** the median (~45–50k RUB/month).
   - This reflects a **small, very highly paid elite** and a broad base of lower‑ and lower‑middle income workers.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.36** and poverty at **≈ 8 %**, Russia looks **less unequal than Latin America or the US**, but **more unequal than most of Europe**.
   - A large group lives **above the official poverty line** but **well below median and mean incomes**, especially outside major cities.

4. **“Wartime prosperity” dynamics**
   - Real wages and real disposable incomes grew **~5–9 %** in 2024–25 [23][24], driven by:
     - **Massive defense spending**,
     - **Labour shortages** (mobilisation, emigration),
     - **State‑guided wage indexation** in key sectors.
   - However, this growth is tied to **war mobilisation and sanctions adaptation**, which may not be **sustainable**.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (to place an individual or household)

### 5.1 For an individual worker (gross monthly wage, Russia‑wide)

Very roughly, around 2025:

- **< 30k RUB/month**
  – **Low income**, often part‑time, informal or low‑skill work; near or below poverty line in big cities.

- **30–50k RUB/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**; typical for many junior clerical, retail, public‑sector, and regional jobs.

- **50–80k RUB/month**
  – **Around the median to moderately above**; many mid‑career workers in manufacturing, construction, some services.

- **80–120k RUB/month**
  – **Upper‑middle**; common for skilled professionals, IT staff, engineers and mid‑level managers.

- **> 120k RUB/month**
  – **High income nationally**; top deciles, especially if located outside Moscow and St Petersburg.

### 5.2 For a household (net monthly income, ≈2.6 persons)

Using the median‑type and poverty thresholds:

- **< 60k RUB/month**
  – Often **below or very near the poverty line**, especially with children.

- **60–100k RUB/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**, basics covered but limited buffers; typical for a single earner on or slightly above median wages.

- **100–180k RUB/month**
  – **Broad middle class**, particularly dual‑earner couples in medium‑cost regions.

- **> 180k RUB/month**
  – **Comfortable to affluent**, especially outside Moscow’s most expensive districts.

## 6. One‑Paragraph “Russia 2025” Snapshot

By **2025**, **Russia** has a **nominal GDP of about \$2.54 trillion** and **GDP per person around \$17,500 (≈ \$49,000 PPP)**, putting it in the ranks of **upper‑middle to high‑income economies**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **46,000 RUB/month (≈ \$6.6k/year)** before tax, while **average wages** are much higher at about **100,000 RUB/month (≈ \$14–15k/year)**, reflecting a **skewed distribution** in which a small elite in sectors like energy, defense industry and finance pulls up the mean. The **median person’s cash income** is only about **35–40k RUB/month (≈ \$4.8k/year)**, and although the **official poverty rate** has fallen to around **8 %**, many households remain just above a **very low poverty line** (≈ 15,552 RUB/person/month). Inequality is **significant (Gini ≈ 0.36)**, the **gender pay gap is extremely large (≈ 49 %)**, unemployment is **record‑low (~2 %)**, and real wages and real disposable incomes grew briskly in 2024–25, largely thanks to **wartime mobilisation and state spending**. The net result is a **war‑boosted but fragile prosperity**: macro indicators and average incomes look strong, but **typical households live far below the aggregate averages**, and the long‑term sustainability of this model is uncertain.
