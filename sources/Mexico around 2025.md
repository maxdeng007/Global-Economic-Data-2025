# Mexico around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Mexico “turn”**, in the same style and level of detail as your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Mexico (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage – the middle of the distribution

The best broad, formal‑sector benchmark for a “typical” wage comes from STPS/IMSS data on average daily earnings:

- **Average daily salary 2025 (Jan–Jun, formal workers)**:
  **622.85 MXN / day** [1].

If we treat this as a good proxy for the **central tendency of formal wages** and multiply by 30 days:

- **Median‑type gross monthly wage (formal)** ≈
  622.85 × 30 ≈ **18,685 MXN / month**.

Using the 2025 average FX rate of **≈ 19.22 MXN/US\$** [18]:

- **≈ 18,685 ÷ 19.22 ≈ US\$970 / month**,
- **≈ US\$11,600–11,700 / year** (before tax).

This reflects **formal, registered employment**; many informal or rural workers earn substantially less.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages – skewed by high earners

Multiple 2025 salary compilations converge on a significantly higher **mean**:

- **Average gross monthly salary, 2025 (all employees)**:
  **≈ 29,200 MXN / month** (≈ **US\$1,520 / month**, **US\$18,200 / year**) [2][19].

Comparing:

- **Median‑type wage:** ~18.7 k MXN/month.
- **Mean wage:** ~29.2 k MXN/month.

So the **average is ≈ 56 % higher than the middle‑of‑the‑distribution worker**, indicating a **strong upper tail** (high‑paid corporate, tech and extractive‑sector roles).

### 1.3 Minimum wage – legal floor

From 1 January 2025:

- **General minimum wage (rest of the country):** **278.80 MXN / day**.
- **Northern Border Free Zone minimum:** **419.88 MXN / day** [3].

Monthly equivalents (30 days):

- **General zone:**
  – **≈ 8,364 MXN / month** → **≈ US\$435 / month**.
- **Border free zone:**
  – **≈ 12,596 MXN / month** → **≈ US\$655 / month**.

Relative to the median‑type wage:

- **General minimum vs median‑type (≈18.7k):** ≈ **45 %**.
- **Border minimum vs median‑type:** ≈ **67 %**.

So a **full‑time minimum‑wage worker** in the rest of the country earns **less than half** what a typical formal worker does; in the border zone, about **two‑thirds**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

A 2025 Worky salary study based on >17,000 employee records shows a large gap:

- **Average women’s net monthly pay:** **23,178 MXN**.
- **Average men’s net monthly pay:** **31,025 MXN** [4].

That is:

- Women earn **about 75 % of men’s pay** – a **≈ 25 % gender wage gap**.

The gap **widens at higher seniority levels** (executive and regional management) and is also reinforced by women’s over‑representation in **lower‑paid, informal or part‑time roles**.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage contrasts

Using Datamexico occupational profiles and specialist salary guides:

**High‑pay sectors (formal):**

- **IT & digital** (OCC Mundial, CodersLink; 2025 guide) [20]:
  - Full‑stack developer: **50,000–70,000 MXN/month**.
  - AI/ML specialist: **80,000–120,000 MXN/month**.
  - Cloud architect: **100,000–130,000 MXN/month**.
  - Cybersecurity specialist: **70,000–110,000 MXN/month**.

- **Finance & insurance**:
  - Finance advisors/analysts: **≈ 13,500 MXN/month** (2025‑Q1) [21].
  - Average across the finance sector: **≈ 8,400 MXN/month** (many support roles) [21].

- **Mining / oil & gas**:
  - Coordinators/managers in mining & oil/gas production: **≈ 18,100 MXN/month** (2025‑Q1) [22].

**Mid‑ and low‑pay sectors:**

- **Teachers (public education)**:
  - Primary school teachers: **≈ 7,020 MXN/month** (2025‑Q1) [23].
  - Secondary school teachers: **≈ 8,230 MXN/month** [24].

- **Agriculture and rural work**:
  - Agricultural workers: **≈ 2,750–3,370 MXN/month** (various Datamexico profiles, 2025‑Q1) [25].

These values show **extreme dispersion**: senior IT roles can pay **5–10×** what primary teachers earn, and **15–30×** what low‑skill agricultural laborers receive.

**Regional differences:**

- STPS/IMSS data show:
  - **National average daily wage 2025 (Jan–Jun):** **622.85 MXN/day** [1].
  - **Mexico City** and some northern states report average daily wages **> 750 MXN/day**, i.e. **20–25 % above** the national mean [26].
  - Southern and rural states can be **10–20 % below** the national average.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Per‑capita and household disposable income

ENIGH 2024, released mid‑2025, gives the clearest national picture:

- **Per‑capita monthly current income (average, 2024):**
  **7,468.65 MXN / person / month** (≈ **US\$388/month**, **US\$4,650/year**) [5].

- **Average quarterly household income (all sources, 2024):**
  ENIGH reports around **77,864–81,920 MXN per quarter**, i.e. **≈ 26,000–27,300 MXN/month per household** [6][27].

Assuming **average household size ≈ 3.5 people**:

- **Mean household income (2024):**
  – ≈ **26,000–27,000 MXN/month** → **≈ US\$1,350–1,400/month**.
- **Median household income** (from decile‑V averages: ≈ 54,300 MXN/quarter):
  – ≈ **18,000 MXN/month** → **≈ US\$940/month** [6].

Thus a **“typical” household** has a disposable income around **18–20 k MXN/month** (median), while better‑off households approach the **26–27 k MXN/month** mean.

A separate **living‑wage** assessment for a single adult in non‑metro areas estimates:

- **Living wage (net, take‑home), 2025:** **14,249 MXN/month** (≈ **US\$742**) [7].
- Gross living wage (before deductions): **≈ 16,567 MXN/month** [7].

### 2.2 Poverty thresholds – what counts as poor

CONEVAL’s **Lines of Poverty by Income, March 2025** [8]:

- **Extreme poverty line (food basket only):**
  - **Rural:** 1,797.48 MXN / person / month.
  - **Urban:** 2,379.47 MXN / person / month.

- **Poverty line (food + non‑food basic basket):**
  - **Rural:** 3,350.38 MXN / person / month.
  - **Urban:** 4,680.15 MXN / person / month.

Interpretation:

- An **urban adult** needs **≥ 4,680 MXN/month** just to be **above monetary poverty**.
- A **typical Mexican’s average monthly income (~7,469 MXN)** is **above** this, but **large shares of the population fall below** the threshold, especially in rural zones and the informal sector.

### 2.3 Poverty rates – labor and multidimensional

Two important perspectives:

1. **Labor poverty** (short‑term, wage‑based – share of people whose **labor income is below the cost of the food basket**):

   - **Q2 2025:** **35.1 %** of the population [9].
   - **Q3 2025:** **34.3 %** [10].

   That is, roughly **one in three Mexicans** has labor earnings **insufficient to buy just the basic food basket**.

2. **Multidimensional poverty** (income + six social deprivation indicators):

   - The World Bank’s 2025 Poverty & Equity Brief notes that the official multidimensional rate fell sharply over 2018–2024, but still stands at **around 29 %** of the population, with **extreme multidimensional poverty** (very low income plus severe deprivation) in the **high single digits** [11].

### 2.4 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Different sources give a coherent picture:

- **World Bank Gini index (income, 2022):** **43.5** (0–100 scale) → **0.435** [13].
- **ENIGH 2024 analysis (INEGI, 2025 release):**
  – Gini for monetary income dropped from **≈ 0.426 (2018)** to **≈ 0.391 (2024)**, the lowest level on record [28].
- **Statista forecast 2025:** **≈ 0.45** (PPP‑based inequality measure) [12].

Reconciling:

- Depending on **data source and definition**, the Gini is in the **0.39–0.45 band**, but all agree it has **fallen somewhat** in recent years.
- Even at ~0.40, Mexico remains **more unequal** than most OECD countries but **less unequal** than the worst Latin‑American cases.

---

## 3. Mexico’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP, per person

Using World Bank and IMF‑based compilations [13][14]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:** **US\$1.86 trillion**.
- **GDP (PPP, 2025):** **US\$3.43 trillion**.
- **Population, 2025:** **≈ 131.95 million**.

Thus:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ US\$13,967 / person** [14].
- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ US\$25,770 / person** [14].

In simple terms:

> Mexico produces **about US\$14k of output per person at market prices**, which translates to **~US\$26k per person in purchasing‑power terms**.

### 3.2 Growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth, 2025:**
  – IMF WEO and Statista: **≈ 1.0 %** (with forecasts in the **0.7–1.5 %** band) [15].

- **Inflation (CPI, 2025):**
  – **Annual inflation 2025:** **≈ 3.69 %** [16].
  – CPI rose **0.28 % in December**, bringing the **full‑year rate to 3.69 %**, down from **4.21 % in 2024** [16][29].

Mexico therefore enters **2026** with:

- **Sub‑4 % inflation**, close to Banxico’s **3 % ±1** target.
- **Low real growth**, but well short of recession in aggregate.

### 3.3 Labour market

World Bank and INEGI figures show:

- **Unemployment rate, 2024:** **2.6 %** (latest full‑year estimate; 2025 remains near this level) [17].
- Even allowing for under‑employment and informality, **headline unemployment is very low** by international standards.

However:

- The **informal employment rate** is **above 50 %** of workers in many quarters [21],
- And **labor‑poverty** around **34–35 %** (see §2.3), so **having a job does not guarantee adequate income**.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

Putting core numbers side‑by‑side:

| Metric (≈2025) | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Nominal GDP per person** | **US\$13,967** |
| **PPP GDP per person** | **US\$25,770** |
| **Median‑type wage (formal)** | **≈ 18.7k MXN/month ≈ US\$970/month (US\$11.7k/year)** |
| **Average gross wage** | **≈ 29.2k MXN/month ≈ US\$1,520/month (US\$18.2k/year)** |
| **Per‑capita monthly income (ENIGH)** | **7,469 MXN/month ≈ US\$388/month (US\$4.65k/year)** |
| **Median household monthly income (3.5 persons)** | **≈ 18k MXN/month ≈ US\$940/month (US\$11.3k/year)** |
| **Urban poverty line (per person)** | **4,680 MXN/month ≈ US\$243/month** |
| **Labor‑poverty rate** | **≈ 34–35 % of population** |
| **Multidimensional poverty** | **≈ 29 %** |
| **Gini (income)** | **≈ 0.40–0.44** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 2.6 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, 2025)** | **≈ 3.7 %** |
| **Real GDP growth (2025)** | **≈ 1.0 %** |

### 4.1 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs personal incomes**
   - **GDP per capita (~US\$14k nominal)** is over **3×** the **average per‑person income (~US\$4.65k/year)** and well above **median household per‑person resources**.
   - The difference reflects:
     - **Profits and retained earnings**,
     - **Taxes and social contributions**,
     - **Public consumption/investment**, and
     - **Depreciation and net external flows**.

2. **Mean vs median wages**
   - With **average wages (~29.2k MXN)** ≈ **56 % above a median‑type wage (~18.7k MXN)**, the **mean** is pulled up by a **relatively small cohort of high earners**.
   - For most Mexicans, **“average salary in Mexico” headlines overstate their reality**.

3. **Low unemployment, high labor poverty**
   - **Unemployment ≈ 2.6 %** coexists with **34–35 % labor‑poverty** because:
     - Many jobs are **informal**,
     - Work is **low‑wage or part‑time**,
     - Entire households rely on **one modest income** or precarious earnings.

4. **Inequality and poverty**
   - Despite **some recent reduction in measured inequality** (ENIGH Gini down toward ~0.39), Mexico remains:
     - **More unequal** than the typical OECD country.
     - With **around 1 in 3 people either poor or near‑poor** by labor or multidimensional indicators.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Mexico 2025)

### 5.1 Individuals – gross monthly pay (MXN)

Approximate brackets to place yourself in the national picture:

- **< 8,500 MXN/month**
  – **Minimum‑wage or very low‑pay work**; likely **poor or near‑poor**, especially in cities or with dependants.

- **8,500–15,000 MXN/month**
  – **Lower‑middle tier**; typical for many basic office, retail, small manufacturing and public‑sector roles.

- **15,000–30,000 MXN/month**
  – **Broad middle range**; around or above the median, common for technicians, mid‑level office roles, some teachers and mid‑skill professionals.

- **30,000–50,000 MXN/month**
  – **Upper‑middle**; experienced professionals, managers, and many IT/finance roles in major urban centers.

- **> 50,000 MXN/month**
  – **High income** by Mexican standards; senior professionals, executives, and top‑end tech, energy and financial positions.

### 5.2 Households – net monthly income (3–4 people, MXN)

Using ENIGH and poverty lines:

- **< 12,000 MXN/month**
  – Typically **below or very near the monetary poverty line**, especially in urban settings.

- **12,000–20,000 MXN/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**, essentials covered but with **limited buffer**; vulnerable to shocks (job loss, illness).

- **20,000–30,000 MXN/month**
  – **Core middle class**; can afford decent housing and basic consumption, some savings, especially outside premium neighborhoods.

- **> 30,000 MXN/month**
  – **Upper‑middle to affluent**; robust capacity to save, invest and handle higher housing costs in large metros.

## 6. Short “Mexico 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Mexico** is an **upper‑middle‑income country** with **nominal GDP around US\$1.86 trillion** and **GDP per person about US\$14,000 (≈ US\$25,700 PPP)**. A **typical formal worker** earns approximately **18,700 MXN/month** (≈ **US\$970/month**), but the **average gross wage** is much higher at **≈ 29,200 MXN/month**, reflecting a **strongly skewed wage distribution**. The **national minimum wage** is **278.80 MXN/day** (≈ **8,364 MXN/month**), while the **gender pay gap** is close to **25 %**, with women earning **three‑quarters** of male net pay on average. Household data (ENIGH 2024) indicate an **average per‑capita income of roughly 7,469 MXN/month**, translating into **median household incomes around 18–20 k MXN/month**, not far above the **urban monetary poverty line of 4,680 MXN/month per person**. Despite **very low unemployment (~2.6 %)** and **inflation easing to ~3.7 %**, **labor‑poverty affects around a third of the population**, and **multidimensional poverty approximately 29 %**, in an economy with **moderate but persistent inequality (Gini ≈ 0.40–0.44)**. In practice, **dual‑earner urban households in the 20–30 k MXN/month range form the core middle class**, while a large share of workers in informal, rural and low‑paid sectors live much closer to subsistence than Mexico’s strong aggregate GDP figures would suggest.
