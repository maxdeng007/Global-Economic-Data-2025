## 1. Salary Levels in Austria (2024–2025)

### 1.1 “Typical” employee vs typical full‑time worker (median)

**Statistics Austria – 2024 personal income (latest full data)**[1]:

- **All employees (incl. part‑time, partial‑year)**
  - **Median gross annual income**: **€38,043**
    → ≈ **€3,170 per month** before tax.

- **Full‑time, full‑year employees only**
  - **Median gross annual income**: **€55,678**
    → ≈ **€4,640 per month** before tax.

These are the **mid‑points** of the distributions. About **half of all employees** earn **less than €38k**, and half more; for **full‑time, full‑year workers**, the mid‑point is close to **€56k**.

Assuming ~1,700 paid hours per year for full‑timers:

- **Median full‑time gross hourly pay**
  ≈ 55,678 ÷ 1,700 ≈ **€32.8 per hour**.

With compensation projected to grow a few percent in 2025, a **good 2025‑era reference** is:

> - **Typical full‑time worker (median)**: around **€57k–58k gross per year**
> - **Typical all‑employee median** (incl. part‑time): a bit above **€38k**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Two complementary views:

1. **Average annual wage – full‑time (all employees)**
   A widely cited 2023 estimate shows for Austria[4]:
   - **Average gross monthly wage**: **€4,757**
   - → **Average gross annual wage**: **€57,084**.

2. **Macro wage indicators (all employees)**
   TradingEconomics series for Austria’s wages indicate:
   - **Average gross monthly income** ≈ **€2,300–2,400** for the overall workforce (including part‑timers), i.e. **≈€27,600–28,800 per year**[3].

This difference reflects that:

- The **€57k/year** figure is for **average full‑time wages**,
- While **€27–29k/year** captures **all employees**, including **part‑time and marginal jobs**.

### 1.3 Gender and occupational differences

From the Statistics Austria income tables[1]:

- **Median gross annual income (all employees)**:
  - **Women**: **€30,380**
  - **Men**: **€45,292**

Women’s median income is therefore about **two‑thirds of men’s**, reflecting higher part‑time rates and occupational segregation.

By major employee group (2024, medians)[1]:

| Group              | Median gross annual income |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Blue‑collar        | **€27,990**               |
| White‑collar       | **€43,280**               |
| Contract workers   | **€46,262**               |
| Civil servants     | **€73,293**               |

Civil servants and many high‑skilled white‑collar employees sit **well above** the overall median.

### 1.4 Minimum wage reality (no statutory floor)

Austria has **no single national statutory minimum wage**. Instead[5]:

- **Minimum wages are set in sectoral collective agreements**.
- By 2025, **most collective agreements guarantee at least €1,700 gross per month**, **paid 14 times a year**, which corresponds to:
  - **≈ €1,983 gross/month on average**,
  - Typically around **€1,350–1,450 net/month** for a full‑time worker.

Coverage is very high (≈95 % of employees), so in practice **very few full‑time employees earn below this level**.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

To compare living standards with other countries, we focus on **net household income after tax** and **equivalised income per person**.

### 2.1 Median household income (net, after tax)

Statistics Austria “Household income” (EU‑SILC 2024, income reference year 2023)[6]:

- **Median net available household income (all private households)**:
  → **€48,303 per year** (≈ **€4,025 per month**).

- **Median equivalised net household income** (adjusted for household size):
  → **€33,210 per year** (≈ **€2,760 per month**).

Interpretation:

- A **“middle” household** in Austria has about **€48k per year to live on**, after taxes and cash transfers.
- For a **typical adult in that household**, adjusted for size, the figure is **~€33k per year**.

### 2.2 Household size and per‑person resources

Average household size is slightly above 2 people:

- **Average household size 2024**: **≈ 2.17 persons**[7].

Combining:

- **Median net household income per person (simple division)**:
  - 48,303 ÷ 2.17 ≈ **€22,300 per person per year**.
- **Equivalised net income (€33,210)** can be read as the **“standard adult” income** after adjusting for children and economies of scale.

### 2.3 Disposable income per person – PPP comparison

A cross‑country PPP compilation reports for Austria[8]:

- **Gross household disposable income per capita (PPP)**: **\$55,616 PPP per person**.

If we reconcile with GDP figures (see section 3), this is plausible:

- GDP per head (PPP) ≈ \$70,000,
- Of which **household disposable income per head** is ≈ \$55–56k PPP.

So the **average Austrian resident**, in purchasing‑power terms, has **about \$55k PPP per year** as disposable income (mean, not median).

### 2.4 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Eurostat (via TradingEconomics) gives[9]:

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income, Austria, 2024**: **28.40 %**.

This places Austria in the group of:

- **Moderately unequal high‑income countries**:
  - **More equal** than the US (≈ 49 %) and the UK (~33 %),
  - Roughly **similar** to Germany and France (~29–30 %),
  - Slightly **less equal** than the very egalitarian Nordics (~25–27 %).

### 2.5 Poverty – at risk of poverty (EU definition)

Eurostat’s **“At Risk of Poverty”** indicator (< 60 % of median equivalised income) for Austria[10]:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (2024)**: **14.30 %** of the population.

So, even in a rich country:

- Roughly **1 in 7 people** live with income **below 60 % of the national median**.
- This share is lower than the EU average but still represents a substantial vulnerable group.

## 3. Austria’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population (2025)

From IMF‑based data compiled by Worldometers[2][11]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **\$566.456 billion**.
- **Population, mid‑2025**: **9,113,574 people**.

This yields:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \approx \frac{\$566{,}456\,000{,}000}{9{,}113{,}574} \approx \$61{,}694 \text{ per person per year}
\]

So Austria’s **nominal GDP per person** in 2025 is about **\$61.7k**.

### 3.2 GDP per capita – PPP

WorldEconomics / IMF PPP data for 2025[12]:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025**: **\$70,116 (international \$) per person**.

So in purchasing‑power terms:

> Austria produces around **\$70k of output per person per year**, slightly higher than many EU peers, and among the **top 15–20 in the world**.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth, 2025**: **0.8 %** (IMF WEO)[13].
- **Inflation (CPI YoY, Dec 2025)**: **3.8 %** (down from 4.0 % in November)[14].

Implications:

- **Real growth is very modest** – the economy is growing slowly in real terms.
- **Inflation**, while down from earlier peaks, is still **somewhat above the ECB’s 2 % target**, but falling.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

Eurostat‑based and national measures show:

- **Unemployment rate (Eurostat, Sept 2025)**: **5.70 %**[15].
- National definition monthly data fluctuate more (e.g., around 7–8 % by national definition), but the harmonised Eurostat figure is around **5½–6 %** for 2025.

This is:

- **Slightly below the EU average** (~6 %),
- Higher than pre‑pandemic lows but not extreme.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Household Incomes Relate

Putting the main numbers next to each other:

| Indicator (Austria ~2025)                          | Approx. value                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)**                       | **\$61,694** (~€55–56k)        |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)**                           | **\$70,116**                   |
| **Median full‑time gross annual wage**             | **€55,678** (2024) → ~€57–58k  |
| **Median net household income (per household)**    | **€48,303 / year**             |
| **Median equivalised net household income (person)**| **€33,210 / year**             |
| **Average disposable income per capita (PPP)**     | **\$55,616 PPP**               |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)**           | **28.4 %**                     |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (< 60 % of median)**     | **14.3 %**                     |

### 4.1 Key relationships

1. **GDP per head vs median full‑time wages**

   - GDP per person: ≈ **\$61.7k**
   - Median full‑time gross pay: **€55.7k** (≈ similar in \$ terms).
   → A **single full‑time worker on the median wage** roughly generates an income **comparable to GDP per head** before tax.

2. **GDP per head vs median disposable income**

   - GDP per head (PPP): ≈ **\$70k**
   - Median equivalised disposable income: **€33.2k** ≈ **\$37–43k PPP**, depending on conversion.
   → Only **around half to two‑thirds of GDP per head shows up as disposable income for the “typical” person**, the rest being:
     - Corporate profits and retained earnings,
     - Taxes and social security contributions,
     - Public consumption and investment,
     - Depreciation and other non‑household uses.

3. **Mean vs median**

   - Mean per‑capita disposable income: **\$55.6k PPP** [8].
   - Median equivalised disposable income: much lower (~€33.2k).
   → This gap reflects **income skewness**: high earners pull up the average.

4. **Inequality and poverty overlay**

   - Gini ≈ **28.4 %** – moderate inequality.
   - About **14 % at risk of poverty** – a **non‑trivial low‑income segment** in a very rich country.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (for Self‑Assessment or Comparison)

### 5.1 For an individual worker (annual gross salary)

Approximate **full‑time benchmarks**:

- **< €35,000 / year**
  → Clearly **below median for full‑time employees**; may indicate part‑time, low‑skill work, or early career.

- **€35,000–€50,000 / year**
  → **Lower‑middle to mid‑range** full‑time salary bracket.

- **€50,000–€60,000 / year**
  → Around or slightly above the **median full‑time** range; typical for many skilled professionals.

- **€60,000–€80,000 / year**
  → **Above average**; often mid‑senior professionals, management, or high‑demand technical roles.

- **> €80,000 / year**
  → **Higher‑income segment**, especially outside Vienna; likely top deciles.

For **minimum‑type pay**, many collective agreements set:

- **≈ €1,700 gross/month (14×)** → **€1,983 gross/month on average**[5], about **€23.8k gross/year**.

### 5.2 For a household (annual net disposable income)

Given **median net household income €48,303/year**[6]:

- **< €30,000 / year** net
  → Often **below** at‑risk‑of‑poverty thresholds for multi‑person households.

- **≈ €40,000–€55,000 / year** net
  → Around the **median living standard** for 2‑person households; modest but not poor.

- **> €60,000 / year** net
  → **Comfortable middle to upper‑middle class**, especially outside the highest‑cost urban areas.
