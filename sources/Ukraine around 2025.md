# Ukraine around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is Ukraine’s “turn”, in the same structured style as your other country profiles. Figures are for **around 2025**, using the latest available estimates and forecasts and explicitly reflecting the impact of Russia’s full‑scale invasion.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Ukraine (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage

Different sources converge on a **typical monthly salary in the high‑20,000 UAH range**:

- State‑statistics‑based labour‑market analysis reports for **late 2025**:
  - **Average wage October 2025:** ≈ **26,900 UAH/month** (full‑time employees) [2].
- A 2025 labour‑market article summarising job‑offer data gives:
  - **Median nominal salary offered (Nov 2025):** ≈ **27,000 UAH/month** (+20 % year‑on‑year) [2].

Given how close the average and this median‑type figure are, a good **“typical worker” benchmark** is:

> **Typical gross monthly salary (median‑type, 2025): ≈ 27,000 UAH**
> → **≈ 324,000 UAH/year**

Using a 2025 average exchange rate of **≈ 41.7 UAH per US\$** [7]:

- **27,000 UAH/month ≈ \$650/month**
- **324,000 UAH/year ≈ \$7,800/year**

This is **before** income tax (18 %) and the 5 % military levy.

### 1.2 Average (mean) and net wages

From multiple 2025 summaries and the Wikipedia economy profile:

- **Average gross monthly salary, early–mid 2025:**
  - **≈ 25,732–26,913 UAH** (varies by month) [1][2][6].
- **Average net monthly salary (after 18 % PIT + 5 % levy):**
  - **≈ 20,328 UAH/month** (≈ **\$490/month**; ≈ **\$5,900/year**) [1][6].

So in compact form:

| 2025 (approx) | UAH/month | UAH/year | USD/month* | USD/year* |
|---------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Median‑type gross salary** | ~27,000 | ~324,000 | ~\$650 | ~\$7,800 |
| **Average gross salary** | ~26,900 | ~322,800 | ~\$645 | ~\$7,700 |
| **Average net salary** | ~20,300 | ~244,000 | ~\$490 | ~\$5,900 |

\*Using ≈41.7 UAH/US\$.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

For **2025**, the **national minimum wage** is:

- **8,000 UAH/month** (full‑time) [6].

In USD:

- **8,000 ÷ 41.7 ≈ \$190/month** (≈ **\$2,300/year**).

Thus a full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns **only about 30 % of the typical worker’s gross pay**.

### 1.4 Sector and regional dispersion

From the 2025 “Average salary in Ukraine” report [6]:

- **By sector (2025, approximate averages):**
  - **Information & telecommunications:** ~**65,000 UAH/month** (≈ \$1,560) – *top‑paying*.
  - **Construction and technical specialities:** often **45,000–55,000 UAH/month** (≈ \$1,080–1,320).
  - **Education:** ~**17,000 UAH/month** (≈ \$410) – *among the lowest*.
  - Many low‑skill services and public‑sector jobs cluster around **12–20k UAH/month**.

- **By region (end‑2025):**
  - **Kyiv:** ≈ **40,700 UAH/month** (≈ \$970).
  - **Luhansk (government‑controlled parts):** > **30,600 UAH/month**.
  - **Dnipropetrovsk:** ~**27,900 UAH/month**.
  - **Chernivtsi, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv:** ~**19–21,000 UAH/month** (lowest end).

The **big picture**:

- Large **Kyiv / big‑city premium** vs. poorer western and northern regions.
- Huge **sector gaps**: IT and high‑tech can pay **3–4×** what education or basic services pay.

### 1.5 Gender pay gap

Pre‑war, official statistics and ILO reporting put the **unadjusted gender pay gap** around **18.6 %** (women earn ≈81–82 % of men’s pay) [8].
2025 strategic documents and labour‑market reviews suggest that:

- The gap **has not narrowed** under wartime conditions and may have **widened somewhat**, especially due to women’s heavier concentration in lower‑paid sectors and care responsibilities.

---

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Disposable income per person

A 2025 forecast of **household disposable income per capita** for Ukraine (Statista Market Forecast) gives:

- **Disposable income per capita 2025:** **US\$6.63k/year** (≈ **US\$552/month**) [4].

Using the same 2025 exchange rate:

- **\$6,630/year ≈ 276,000 UAH/year**, or
- **≈ 23,000 UAH/month per person** (average).

This is an **average**, not a median. With high inequality (see below), the **median person’s disposable income** is **noticeably lower** than \$6.63k/year.

### 2.2 Household level

Average household size around **2025** is about **3.1 persons** [9]. Combining with the per‑capita disposable figure:

\[
23{,}000\ \text{UAH/month} \times 3.1 \approx 71{,}300\ \text{UAH/month}
\]

So a **typical (mean) household** has **≈ 71,000 UAH/month** disposable cash (≈ \$1,700/month; ≈ \$20,000/year).

Because of the strong skew, a **median household** has **less than this**.

### 2.3 Poverty

The **World Bank’s “Listening to Citizens of Ukraine” fall‑2025 update** reports:

- **Poverty rate 2025:** **36.9 %** (preliminary) [5].

Details:

- This is based on an **adult‑equivalent minimum subsistence threshold of 8,312 UAH/month** (average May–July 2025) [5].
- The 36.9 % rate is **nearly unchanged from 2024 (37.0 %)** and **far above pre‑2022 levels**, where poverty was in the low teens.
- Vulnerable groups:
  - **Children** – poverty near **30 %**.
  - **Single‑parent families** – often **>40 %** poor.
  - **Large households and rural areas** – substantially above the national average.

In plain terms:

> Roughly **one in three Ukrainians** is **below the national basic‑needs line** in 2025.

### 2.4 Inequality – Gini coefficient

The same World Bank source documents a sharp rise in inequality:

- **Gini (income) 2023:** **0.41**
- **Gini 2025:** **0.50** [5].

A Gini of **0.50** is extremely high by European standards, and comparable to some Latin‑American economies. It means:

- The **top 10–20 % of households capture a very large share of income and wealth**.
- The **bottom half** sees relatively little of the overall economic gains.

## 3. Ukraine’s GDP and GDP per Person

### 3.1 Size of the economy (nominal and PPP)

From IMF‑based datasets and Worldometer compilations:

| Indicator (2025) | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| **Nominal GDP (current prices)** | **≈ \$209.7 billion** [3] |
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **≈ \$6,720** [1][3][11] |
| **Population (mid‑2025)** | **≈ 38.98 million** [3] |
| **GDP (PPP)** | **≈ \$686.9 billion** [10] |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | **≈ \$20,904** [10] |

Thus:

- At **market prices**, Ukraine is producing roughly **\$6.7k per person per year**.
- After adjusting for **cheaper local prices (PPP)**, the real purchasing‑power equivalent is about **\$20.9k per person**.

### 3.2 Growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth 2025:**
  - IMF WEO data: **≈ 2.0 %** [11].
- **Inflation (CPI)**:
  - **Oct 2025:** **10.9 % YoY**;
  - **Nov 2025:** **9.3 % YoY** (food inflation even higher) [8].
  - Full‑year average for 2025 is around **10 %**.

Interpretation:

- The economy is **growing modestly in real terms**, but **price levels are rising quickly**.
- **Real wages and real household incomes** are under pressure, despite nominal pay increases.

### 3.3 Labour market

Unemployment estimates vary because official surveys were disrupted by war, but:

- **IMF unemployment rate 2025:** **≈ 10.2 %** [12].
- Other sources citing surveys and modelling often give **12–15 %** in specific months or quarters.

So:

> Official unemployment is **high but not catastrophic**, yet **under‑employment, informality and discouraged workers** are significant, especially in war‑affected regions.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Comparing per‑person GDP and incomes

Side‑by‑side (approximate 2025 values):

| Metric | Approximate value |
|--------|-------------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)** | **\$6,720/year** |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | **\$20,900/year** |
| **Median‑type worker’s gross salary** | **\$7,800/year** |
| **Average per‑person disposable income** | **\$6,630/year** |
| **Average worker’s net pay** | **\$5,900/year** |
| **Poverty line (per adult)** | **≈ 8,312 UAH/month (~\$200)** |
| **Poverty rate** | **36.9 %** |
| **Gini (income)** | **0.50** |

Key points:

1. **GDP per person (nominal, \$6.7k)** is in the same ballpark as the **typical worker’s annual gross salary (\$7.8k)** – unsurprising, since the GDP figure must be spread over **workers plus non‑workers (children, elderly, soldiers, displaced)**.

2. In **PPP terms**, GDP/head (~\$20.9k) is **much higher** than the average disposable income per head (~\$6.6k). The difference reflects:
   - The share of GDP that goes to **corporate profits, investment and depreciation**,
   - **Taxes and social contributions**,
   - **Government consumption** (defence, public services),
   - War‑related destruction and losses that do **not** translate into private incomes.

3. **High inequality (Gini 0.50)** and a **36.9 % poverty rate** mean:
   - **A minority at the top** has living standards approaching or exceeding middle‑income European levels.
   - A **very large share of households** lives on incomes **barely above or below basic‑needs thresholds**.

### 4.2 Real wages vs inflation

- **Average nominal wages** rose from ~25–26k UAH to ~27k UAH/month across 2024–25 [2][6].
- **Inflation** in the same period runs ~10 % annually [8].

This implies:

> For many workers, **real wages have been flat or falling**: nominal gains do not keep up with rising food, housing and utilities costs.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks

### 5.1 For individuals (gross monthly pay, 2025)

You can roughly situate yourself in Ukraine using **gross monthly income**:

- **< 8,000 UAH (≈ \$190)**
  - **Below or at minimum wage.** Typically part‑time, informal or very low‑skill work.

- **8,000–15,000 UAH (≈ \$190–360)**
  - **Low‑income tier.** Common in basic services, small retail, some rural jobs.

- **15,000–25,000 UAH (≈ \$360–600)**
  - **Lower‑middle range.** Many entry‑level office roles, junior technicians, rural professionals.

- **25,000–35,000 UAH (≈ \$600–840)**
  - **Around and above the national median.** Typical for mid‑career professionals, especially outside Kyiv.

- **35,000–50,000+ UAH (≈ \$840–1,200+)**
  - **Upper‑middle to high income.** Often IT, finance, large‑firm managers, or in Kyiv’s higher‑pay segments.

### 5.2 For households (net disposable income, 2025)

For a **3‑person household** (close to the average size):

- **< 45,000 UAH/month (≈ \$1,080)**
  - Likely **below or near the poverty line**, especially with children.

- **45,000–65,000 UAH/month (≈ \$1,080–1,560)**
  - **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but vulnerable to shocks, rent hikes, or medical bills.

- **65,000–85,000 UAH/month (≈ \$1,560–2,040)**
  - **Broad middle‑class** in many urban settings; able to save modestly.

- **> 85,000 UAH/month (≈ \$2,040+)**
  - **Upper‑middle class and above**, especially outside Kyiv’s most expensive districts.

## 6. One‑Paragraph “Ukraine 2025” Snapshot

In **2025**, **Ukraine** is a **war‑torn but functioning economy** with **nominal GDP around \$210 billion** and **GDP per capita about \$6,700 (or \$20,900 PPP)**. A **typical worker** earns roughly **27,000 UAH/month** (≈ **\$650/month**) before tax, and about **20,000 UAH/month** (≈ **\$490/month**) after tax, while the **average household** has around **71,000 UAH/month** (≈ **\$1,700/month**) in disposable income. Yet **inequality is extreme** (Gini **0.50**) and **poverty is widespread**: about **36.9 % of Ukrainians** live below the national basic‑needs line, with **children and single‑parent families** hardest hit. Inflation around **10 %** eats into real incomes, so nominal wage growth does not translate into better living standards for most. In short, Ukraine’s macro numbers show **substantial output per person**, but the war, high prices, and a highly unequal distribution mean that **a majority of households experience a precarious, low‑to‑middle living standard**, while a relatively small top tier captures much of the economic upside.
