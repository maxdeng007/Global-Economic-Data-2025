# South Korea around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is a South‑Korea‑focused report in the same spirit as the UK, China, Japan, Germany, France and US summaries you already have: **wages → household incomes & inequality → GDP & GDP per head → how they fit together and benchmarks.**

## 1. Salary Levels in South Korea (2025)

### 1.1 Median (mid‑point) wage – “typical” worker

Multiple recent sources summarising Statistics Korea data converge on a **median gross salary** of:

- **Median salary (all employees)**: **≈ 3,500,000 KRW per month**
  → **≈ 42,000,000 KRW per year** (pre‑tax).
  → At the **2025 average FX** (≈ 1,421 KRW per US\$), this is roughly **\$29,500/year**.

If we treat this as typical full‑time earnings and assume ≈174 work hours per month:

- **Median hourly wage**:
  3,500,000 ÷ 174 ≈ **20,100 KRW/hour** ≈ **\$14.20/hour**.

Interpretation:

- This is the **mid‑point** of the wage distribution:
  **50 % of workers earn less than ~3.5M KRW/month; 50 % earn more.**

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage – all workers

Using CEIC’s compiled “Monthly Earnings” indicator and 2025 FX:

- **Average monthly earnings, Oct 2025**: **\$2,953**
  → In KRW at 1,421 KRW/\$: ≈ **4.2 million KRW per month**.
- **Average annual wage**:
  ≈ 4.2M × 12 ≈ **50.4 million KRW per year** ≈ **\$35,400/year**.

Approximate **average hourly wage** (same 174 hours/month assumption):

- 4,200,000 ÷ 174 ≈ **24,100 KRW/hour** ≈ **\$17/hour**.

So, in compact form:

| 2025 (approx) | KRW/month | KRW/year | USD/year |
|---------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Median wage** | ~3.5M | ~42M | ~\$29.5k |
| **Average wage** | ~4.2M | ~50.4M | ~\$35.4k |

> The **average** is higher than the **median**, reflecting a **right‑tail of high earners**.

### 1.3 Minimum wage (floor of the labour market)

The **official national minimum wage** for **2025** is:

- **10,030 KRW per hour**
  – **Daily (8 hours)**: 80,240 KRW
  – **Monthly (standard 209 hours)**: **2,096,270 KRW** ≈ **\$1,475**.

A full‑time worker on the minimum wage earns **roughly 60 % of the median wage**.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 “Typical” household disposable income

Korea’s main official series is **household disposable income** (after direct taxes and social contributions).

From KOSTAT’s **Household Income and Expenditure Trends, Q2 2024**:

- **Third income quintile (the middle 20 % of households)** – a good proxy for the **median**:
  – **Monthly disposable income per household**: **3,443,000 KRW**.

Annualised:

- **Median‑type disposable income per household**:
  3.443M × 12 ≈ **41.3 million KRW per year** ≈ **\$29,000/year**.

Using the **average household size (2024)**:

- **Average household size**: **2.19 persons**.

Then:

- **Median‑type disposable income per person**:
  41.3M ÷ 2.19 ≈ **18.9 million KRW per year**.

In **PPP terms**, with **2024 PPP factor 838.9 KRW per international \$**:

- 18.9M ÷ 838.9 ≈ **\$22,500 PPP per person per year**.

> **So the “typical” Korean, in terms of post‑tax income, lives on about 19M KRW per year (≈ \$22–23k PPP).**

### 2.2 “Standard median income” used for welfare

Separately from KOSTAT’s survey medians, the **Ministry of Health and Welfare** sets an official **“standard median income”** used to determine eligibility for social benefits under the **National Basic Living Security System**.

For **2026**, which is based on 2025 income data and raised by 6.51 % year‑on‑year:

- **Standard median income (4‑person household, 2026)**: **6,494,738 KRW per month** (≈ \$4,900)
  → **~77.9M KRW per year**.

Rolling back 6.51 % gives an implied 2025 reference around **6.1M KRW/month**. This *standard* is used for welfare thresholds and sits **well above** the survey‑based median disposable income of typical households (≈3.4M KRW/month), because it reflects a particular policy definition, not the raw survey median.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

KOSTAT’s **“Social Indicators in 2024”** report:

- **Gini coefficient (disposable income, 2023)**: **0.323**.

Later commentary for 2024 indicates:

- **2024 Gini coefficient**: **≈ 0.325**, a slight uptick compared with 2023.

Interpretation:

- **South Korea’s inequality is moderate to high**:
  - **Higher** than the most equal OECD countries (Nordics at ~0.26–0.28).
  - **Lower** than very high inequality cases such as the US (~0.48) or many Latin‑American countries.

### 2.4 Poverty

Two views matter:

1. **Relative poverty** (European/OECD style, income < 50 % of median):

   - Our World in Data gives **South Korea’s relative poverty** at **≈ 12.7 % in 2024** – about **1 in 8 people** living on less than **half of the national median income**.
   - OECD work and reporting in 2022–2023 suggest a broader range of **14–17 %** depending on exact definition and cut‑offs.

2. **Elderly poverty**:

   - OECD and Korean media consistently report that **around 40 % of people aged 65+** live below 50 % of the median income – **one of the highest elderly‑poverty rates in the OECD**.

> In short, **South Korea has eliminated extreme poverty** by global standards, but **relative poverty remains significant**, especially for **older adults and low‑income households**.

## 3. South Korea’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Level

### 3.1 Nominal GDP (current prices)

IMF‑based data (via Worldometers and Wikipedia) for **2025**:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **\$1.86 trillion** (≈ **\$1,858.6 billion**).
- With **average 2025 FX** of **1,421 KRW/\$**, this implies:

  \[
  1.8586\ \text{trillion} \times 1421 \approx 2,640\ \text{trillion KRW}
  \]

### 3.2 GDP in PPP terms

IMF estimates for **PPP‑adjusted GDP (2025)**:

- **GDP (PPP), 2025**: **\$2.36 trillion**.

This is expressed in **international dollars**, adjusting for South Korea’s lower price levels relative to some advanced economies.

### 3.3 Population

Worldometers mid‑2025 estimate:

- **Population, mid‑2025**: **≈ 51.67 million**.

The population has begun to **decline slightly** due to very low fertility.

### 3.4 GDP per person

Using the above:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025**:

  \[
  \frac{\$1.86\ \text{trillion}}{51.67\ \text{million}} 
  \approx \$36,000\ \text{per person per year}
  \]

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025**:

  \[
  \frac{\$2.36\ \text{trillion}}{51.67\ \text{million}} 
  \approx \$45,700\ \text{per person per year (PPP)}
  \]

So, **South Korea produces roughly 51 million KRW (≈ \$36k) of output per person per year at market prices**, or around **\$45–46k per person** once adjusted for purchasing power.

### 3.5 Real growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth, 2025**:
  – IMF’s 2025 Article IV communication and Korean press put this at roughly **0.9 %**.

- **Inflation (CPI), 2025**:
  – Official data and media summarise **average CPI inflation at 2.1 %** in 2025 (lowest in about 5 years).

Interpretation:

- 2025 is a year of **low real growth** and **moderate inflation**:
  - **Real GDP per person** is almost flat (close to 0–1 % growth).
  - Most gains in nominal income are absorbed by inflation and demographics.

## 4. GDP vs Wages vs Household Incomes – How They Relate

Putting the numbers side‑by‑side:

| Indicator (2025‑ish) | Approximate Value |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)** | ~\$36,000 |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | ~\$45,700 |
| **Median gross wage (full‑time, annual)** | ~42M KRW ≈ \$29,500 |
| **Average gross wage (full‑time, annual)** | ~50.4M KRW ≈ \$35,400 |
| **Median disposable income per household** | ~41.3M KRW/year ≈ \$29,000 |
| **Median disposable income per person** | ~18.9M KRW/year ≈ \$22,500 PPP |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | ~0.32 |
| **Relative poverty (<50 % median)** | ~13 % of population |

Key points:

1. **GDP per person (\$36k)** is **significantly higher** than:
   - The **typical worker’s gross wage** (~\$29.5k), and
   - The **typical person’s disposable income** (~\$22.5k PPP).

2. This reflects the standard macro identity:
   - Some of GDP is **retained by firms** (profits, investment),
   - Some is **collected as tax** and used for **public spending**,
   - Only part flows through as **household disposable income**.

3. **Inequality** (Gini ≈ 0.32) and **relative poverty** (~13 %) mean:
   - Many households, especially **elderly and low‑skilled**, live **well below** the median,
   - While a smaller upper tier captures a large share of total income and assets.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (How to Use These Numbers)

### 5.1 If you are working in South Korea

Use these broad **gross monthly salary ranges** to situate yourself:

- **< 2.1M KRW/month**
  – Close to or not far above the **minimum wage**.
  – Lower end of the distribution; typical of part‑time, entry‑level or low‑skill positions.

- **≈ 2.5–3.5M KRW/month**
  – **Below to around the median** full‑time wage.
  – Many junior office workers, teachers, service jobs fall here.

- **≈ 3.5–4.5M KRW/month**
  – Around the **typical full‑time range**, slightly above the median.
  – Average skill professionals in larger cities.

- **> 5M KRW/month**
  – **Above average**; mid‑senior professionals, specialists, some tech and finance roles.

- **> 8M KRW/month**
  – **Top decile territory**; senior management, high‑end professionals, or niche technical roles.

### 5.2 Household income perspective

For a **2‑person household**, you can think in annual disposable income:

- **< 30M KRW/year**
  – Clearly **below median**; financial stress likely, especially in Seoul/major metros.

- **≈ 40–50M KRW/year**
  – **Around the median** living standard (nationally).
  – Typical of two modest earners or a single mid‑range earner supporting one dependent.

- **> 70M KRW/year**
  – **Comfortable**, above median in most regions, especially outside Seoul.

### 5.3 International comparison (against the other countries you asked about)

- **GDP per head (PPP)** of **\$45–46k** puts South Korea:
  - Below the US (~\$75k PPP), Germany (~\$73k PPP), and Japan (~\$52k PPP),
  - Well above large middle‑income countries (China ~\$20–30k PPP).

- **Median per‑person disposable income** (~\$22–23k PPP) is:
  - **Much lower** than the US and Germany,
  - Comparable or slightly above many Southern European countries,
  - Higher than most middle‑income Asian economies.
