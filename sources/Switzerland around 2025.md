# Switzerland around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the Switzerland “turn”, aligned with your previous country profiles (South Korea, Italy, Spain, Austria, Canada, Australia, India, Israel, Ukraine, Russia).

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Switzerland (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median) full‑time wage

Official earnings data for the whole Swiss economy (private + public) show:

- **Median gross monthly wage, full‑time (2024)**: **CHF 7,024**
  → **CHF 84,288 per year** before tax \[1\].

Using the 2025 initial wage‑growth estimate:

- **Nominal wage growth 2025 (initial FSO estimate)**: **≈ 2.3 %** \[2\].

So a reasonable **2025 median full‑time wage** is:

\[
7{,}024 \times 1.023 \approx \textbf{CHF 7,186 per month}
\]

Assuming ~174 hours/month (38‑hour week):

- **Median gross hourly wage** ≈ **CHF 41–42/hour**.

At the **2025 average FX** (≈ **1 CHF = 1.207 USD** \[12\]):

- **Median full‑time salary 2025**:
  – ≈ **CHF 86,200/year** → **≈ \$104,000/year**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage

A 2025 salary guide compiling official and survey data finds:

- **Average annual gross salary (all employees, 2025)**: **≈ CHF 95,000**
  → **≈ CHF 7,917/month** \[3\].

Converted:

- **Average annual wage**:
  – 95,000 × 1.207 ≈ **\$114,600/year**.

So:

- **Median full‑time wage 2025**: **≈ CHF 7,200/month**
- **Average wage 2025**: **≈ CHF 7,900/month**

The **mean is clearly higher than the median**, indicating a **right‑skewed distribution** with a sizeable upper‑income tail (finance, pharma, top management).

### 1.3 Minimum wage – cantonal, not national

Switzerland has **no national statutory minimum wage**. Instead, several cantons and many collective agreements set minimums:

Examples for **2025** \[3\]\[11\]:

| Canton | 2025 minimum wage | Comment |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Geneva** | **CHF 24.48/hour** | General cantonal minimum. |
| **Neuchâtel** | **CHF 21.31/hour** | For workers without a collective agreement. |
| **Jura** | **CHF 21.40/hour** | Applies in 2025 (last rise July 2024). |
| **Basel‑Stadt** | **CHF 22.00/hour** | For all workers without CLA. |

Approximate **full‑time equivalent (38 h/week)**:

- Geneva:
  24.48 × 38 × 4.33 ≈ **CHF 4,900–5,100/month**.

So, very broadly:

- **Minimum‑type full‑time wage**: **≈ CHF 4,500–5,100/month**,
- That is about **60–70 % of the median full‑time wage**.

### 1.4 Household‑level context (gross)

A 2025 relocation/salary guide summarising Swiss official data reports \[4\]:

- **Median gross household income**: **≈ CHF 10,500/month**.

Roughly:

- **Single professionals**: typical gross **CHF 6,500–7,500/month**.
- **Dual‑earner couples**: often **CHF 12,000–15,000/month** gross.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Average and median disposable income

The **Household Budget Survey 2023** (FSO) shows:

- **Average household disposable income, 2023**: **CHF 7,186/month** \[1\]\[6\].

This is **after** income tax, social security contributions and compulsory health insurance premiums.

- A widely‑cited analysis notes that **about 61 % of households** have disposable income **below this average** \[6\], so **median disposable income** is lower, roughly in the **CHF 6,500–7,000/month** band.

Using average household size ≈ **2.5 persons**, this implies:

\[
\text{Median‑type per‑person disposable} \approx \frac{6{,}700 \times 12}{2.5} \approx \textbf{CHF 32,000/year}
\]

FSO income‑distribution statistics provide a **median equivalised disposable income** (adjusted for household size):

- **Median equivalised disposable income, 2023**: **CHF 51,973/year** \[1\].
  → ≈ **CHF 4,331/month per “standard adult”**.

Converted at 1.207:

- **≈ \$63,000/year PPP‑like disposable income per standard adult**.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

FSO’s 2023 income‑distribution report and EEA’s country page show \[6\]:

- **Gini index (equivalised disposable income, 2023)**: **31.5** (scale 0–100).

On the usual 0–1 scale this is **≈ 0.315**. Interpretation:

- **More equal** than high‑inequality economies like the US (~0.48–0.49).
- **Somewhat more unequal** than very egalitarian Nordics (~0.26–0.28).
- Slightly **above** Germany/France (~0.29–0.30).

So Switzerland has **moderate income inequality by rich‑country standards**.

### 2.3 Poverty

The **Poverty Monitoring Report 2025** (based on 2023 SILC data) finds \[5\]\[8\]:

- **Income‑poverty rate (below social subsistence minimum)**: **8.1 %** of the resident population (2023).
- This has remained **near 8–9 %** for several years; **no major decline** since 2017.

Key points:

- Poverty is **twice as high among retirement‑age people** compared with those 0–64.
- **Single‑parent households** and families with **three or more children** are markedly more affected.
- A separate press summary notes that **CHF 15 billion in social transfers** reduces an underlying pre‑transfer poverty rate of ≈ **31.7 %** down to **8.1 %** \[8\] – the welfare state is very redistributive, but a non‑trivial poor group remains.

### 2.4 Wealth inequality

Though your question is income‑focused, it matters that:

- UBS Global Wealth Report 2025 (not scraped directly but widely summarised) gives Switzerland a **wealth Gini ≈ 0.86** – **extremely high** wealth concentration.

So while **income inequality is moderate**, **asset inequality is among the highest in the world**.

## 3. Switzerland’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Levels

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

IMF‑based 2025 data (Worldometer) \[7\]\[9\]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **≈ \$1.06–1.11 trillion** (we’ll use the per‑capita table value).
- **Population, mid‑2025**: **8,967,407 people** \[9\].

The same source’s per‑capita table gives:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025**: **\$111,047** \[7\]\[10\].

So at market prices, the Swiss economy produces about **\$111k per person per year**.

### 3.2 PPP GDP per capita

From IMF WEO 2025 as compiled by Worldometer’s PPP table \[10\]:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025**: **\$97,659 (international dollars)**.

This is slightly **below** the nominal figure because Swiss prices are high relative to the world average.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

- IMF and Swiss economic forecast notes (SNB, SECO) point to **real GDP growth ≈ 1.0–1.8 %** in 2025.
- FSO CPI release for **November 2025**:
  – **Year‑on‑year inflation**: **0.0 %** (exactly flat) \[11\].
  – **Month‑on‑month change**: **‑0.2 %**, CPI level **107.0** (Dec 2020=100).

SNB projections, SECO forecast:

- **Average inflation 2025**: **≈ 0.2 %** \[2\][16].

Thus, **real wages and real disposable incomes are rising** – nominal pay is up ~2.3 %, prices ~0–0.2 %.

### 3.4 Labour market

TradingEconomics/FSO labour data:

- **Unemployment rate (non‑seasonally adjusted, November 2025)**: **2.9 %** \[10\].
- **Seasonally adjusted**: **3.0 %**.

ILO‑definition unemployment:

- **Q3 2025**: **≈ 5.1 %** (ILO concept) \[10\] – higher because it follows the broader survey definition.

Still, both measures indicate a **tight labour market** by European standards.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Side‑by‑side key figures (circa 2025)

| Indicator | Approximate value |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$111,047** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **\$97,659** |
| **Median full‑time gross wage** | **CHF 7,186/month ≈ CHF 86,200/year ≈ \$104k/year** |
| **Average gross wage** | **CHF 95,000/year ≈ \$115k/year** |
| **Average household disposable income** | **CHF 7,186/month ≈ CHF 86,200/year ≈ \$104k/year** |
| **Median‑type household disposable income** | **≈ CHF 6,500–7,000/month** |
| **Median equivalised disposable income** | **CHF 51,973/year** (≈ \$62–63k/year per standard adult) \[1\] |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | **0.315** |
| **Income‑poverty rate** | **8.1 %** (2023) |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 3 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, 2025)** | **≈ 0.2 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs typical incomes**
   - GDP per person (≈ **\$111k**) is **higher than even the average wage** and **much higher** than **median per‑person disposable income** (~CHF 32–52k/year depending on equivalence).
   - This is normal: a big chunk of GDP is **corporate profits**, **taxes**, **public consumption** and **depreciation**, not directly in people’s paychecks.

2. **Wages vs household disposable income**
   - A single full‑time worker earning the **median wage** (~CHF 7.2k/month) will, after taxes and insurance, bring home something not far from the **median household’s disposable income** when spread across **2–3 people**.
   - The **average household disposable income** (~CHF 7,186/month) being similar to the **median full‑time wage** reflects the role of:
     – multiple earners,
     – non‑labour income (pensions, investments),
     – and the fact that many households are smaller than 2.5 people (singles, couples without children).

3. **Inequality overlay**
   - Gini ≈ **0.315** and strong mean‑median gaps signal that a **smaller, higher‑income stratum** (finance, high‑end services, corporate management) pulls averages far above what many households experience.
   - However, compared with many peers, Switzerland still has **relatively low income poverty (8.1 %)**, thanks to large social transfers (≈ CHF 15 bn/year trimming “underlying” poverty from ~31.7 % to 8.1 % \[8\]).

4. **Wealth vs income**
   - **Wealth inequality is extreme** (wealth Gini ≈ 0.86). Even if **most working‑age people have comfortable incomes**, **asset ownership is heavily concentrated**, affecting long‑term security and political economy.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (2025‑style)

### 5.1 For individuals – gross monthly salary

Approximate **Switzerland‑wide guide**:

- **< CHF 5,000/month**
  – Clearly **below median**; often part‑time or lower‑skill work (retail, hospitality, some admin).
- **CHF 5,000–7,000/month**
  – **Lower‑middle to mid‑range**; many junior professionals, technicians, teachers.
- **CHF 7,000–9,000/month**
  – Around / somewhat above the **median**; mid‑career professionals in typical cantons.
- **CHF 9,000–12,000/month**
  – **Upper‑middle**; experienced specialists, engineers, mid‑level management.
- **> CHF 12,000/month**
  – **Top tier** nationally; senior management, banking/finance, top consulting, specialised physicians, etc.

### 5.2 For households – net (disposable) monthly income

For a **2–3 person household**:

- **< CHF 5,000–6,000/month**
  – Often **near or below the poverty line**, especially with children, in high‑rent cities.
- **CHF 6,000–9,000/month**
  – **Lower‑middle to solid middle**; comfortable but with limited savings margin in Zurich/Geneva.
- **CHF 9,000–13,000/month**
  – **Comfortable middle to upper‑middle class**; good ability to save, high standard of living.
- **> CHF 13,000/month**
  – **Affluent**; clearly above the living standard of the typical Swiss household.

## 6. Short Switzerland‑2025 Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Switzerland** is one of the **richest economies in the world**, with **nominal GDP per person ≈ \$111,000** and **PPP GDP per head ≈ \$97,700**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **CHF 7,200/month** (≈ **\$104k/year**), while **average wages** are higher at roughly **CHF 95,000/year**. After taxes, social contributions and compulsory health insurance, a **typical household** has about **CHF 6,500–7,000/month** in **disposable income**, and the **average** is **CHF 7,186/month**. Income inequality is **moderate** (Gini ≈ 0.315), and an extensive welfare system reduces an underlying **pre‑transfer poverty rate** of about **31.7 %** down to **8.1 %**. Unemployment is **very low (≈ 3 %)**, inflation is **around 0.2 %**, and real wages are **rising modestly**. At the same time, **wealth is extremely concentrated**, housing and health‑insurance costs are high, and a meaningful minority – particularly **single parents, large families and some older people** – live on incomes close to or below the poverty threshold, despite the country’s exceptional average prosperity.
