# Egypt around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Egypt “turn”**, following the same structure as your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Egypt (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage  

Using the best available wage surveys and national data:

- **Median gross monthly salary (all employees)**  
  – Approx. **7,800 EGP/month** (often cited as **7,840 EGP**) [6].  
  – With the 2025 average rate **1 EGP ≈ 0.020 USD** (≈ **49 EGP/\$**) [10]:  
    - **≈ \$155–160/month**,  
    - **≈ \$1,850–1,900/year**.

Assuming ≈165 hours/month:

- **Median gross hourly wage**  
  \[
  7{,}800 \div 165 \approx 47\ \text{EGP/hour} \approx \$0.95/hour
  \]

This is a reasonable **“typical worker”** benchmark in Egypt’s formal sector.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

CAPMAS’ official wage report (via Amwal Al Ghad):

- **Average gross monthly wage, 2023 (public + private):** **5,005 EGP/month** [4].  
  – Up **16.8 %** from 4,284 EGP in 2022.  
- **Public sector average:** **12,401 EGP/month**.  
- **Private sector average:** **4,675 EGP/month** [4].

In USD (≈49 EGP/\$):

- **Overall mean wage:** ≈ **\$100–105/month**.  

This **official mean** is **lower than the survey‑based median (~7,800 EGP)** from private data [6], indicating:

- CAPMAS is capturing **all employees**, including many **part‑time, casual, and very low‑paid jobs**,  
- Private salary surveys skew toward **formal and better‑paid roles**.

In international guides (Time Champ, etc.):

- **Average monthly salary (formal jobs, 2024):** **≈13,244 EGP/month** (≈ \$430) [1].  

So you effectively have **two “averages”**:

- **CAPMAS (all employees):** ~**5,000 EGP**,  
- **Formal‑job surveys:** **≈ 9,000–13,000 EGP**.  

For **“how a typical full‑time formal worker lives”**, the **7,800–10,000 EGP/month** window is most useful; the **5,000 EGP** is a conservative national mean including low‑paid, informal, or short‑hours work.

### 1.3 Minimum wage  

Egypt has both public‑ and private‑sector minimum wages. For 2025:

- **Private sector national minimum wage** (National Council of Wages):  
  – From **1 March 2025:** **7,000 EGP/month** [5][3].  

TradingEconomics confirms:

- **Minimum wage 2025:** **7,000 EGP/month** – an all‑time high [1].  

Relative to typical wages:

- **Minimum vs “median‑type” formal wage (~7,800 EGP):** ≈ **90 %**.  
- **Minimum vs CAPMAS mean (~5,005 EGP):** ≈ **140 %**.

Interpretation:

- Legally, the **minimum is set close to what many formal workers actually earn**.  
- In practice, **large parts of the private and informal sectors still pay at or below this level**, especially outside Cairo.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

CAPMAS 2023 data (all sectors) show [4]:

- **Average wage for men:** **5,128 EGP/month**.  
- **Average wage for women:** **4,439 EGP/month**.  

So:

\[
\text{Gap} = \frac{5{,}128 - 4{,}439}{5{,}128} \approx 13.4\%
\]

> **Women earn about 13–14 % less per month than men, on average.**

This is a **raw (unadjusted) gap**; adjusted estimates from academic work often land in the **10–20 %** band depending on sector.

The **Global Gender Gap Report 2025** also notes that **women’s estimated income is far below men’s**, but that’s a broader lifetime‑income gap, not just wage rates.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage differences  

From CAPMAS and multiple salary studies [1][4]:

- **Public vs private:**
  - Public‑sector employees: **≈ 12,400 EGP/month** on average.  
  - Private‑sector employees: **≈ 4,675 EGP/month** on average [4].

- **Higher‑pay sectors:**
  - **Banking & finance, telecoms, IT & software, large manufacturing, private healthcare.**  
  - Many mid‑career professionals: **≈ 12,000–25,000 EGP/month** (≈ \$240–510).

- **Mid‑range sectors:**
  - **Public education, mid‑level nurses, engineers, mid‑office roles, logistics.**  
  - Often **6,000–12,000 EGP/month**.

- **Low‑pay sectors:**
  - **Retail, hospitality, domestic work, informal services, agriculture, many factory jobs.**  
  - Commonly **3,000–6,000 EGP/month**, sometimes below the official minimum once under‑reporting is factored in.

**Regional variation:**

- **Cairo & Greater Cairo:**  
  – Wages **≈ 10–15 % above** national averages for similar occupations; also **highest housing and transport costs**.  
- **Alexandria & Red Sea resorts (Hurghada, Sharm El‑Sheikh):**  
  – Slight wage premium in tourism and logistics, but highly **seasonal**.  
- **Rural and Upper Egypt:**  
  – Wages for many jobs **10–20 % below** national averages, and informality is widespread.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household income & consumption  

Direct, up‑to‑date median household income figures from CAPMAS are not public, but **consumption‑based proxies** exist:

- **Household final consumption expenditure per capita, 2024 (PPP, constant 2021 \$):**  
  – **\$13,256 per person per year** [14].  

Egypt’s 2025 population and household structure:

- **Population (mid‑2025):** **118.37 million** [13].  
- **Number of households, 2025:** **23.8 million** [11].  
  → **Average household size ≈ 118.37 / 23.8 ≈ 5 persons** (consistent with other sources showing ~4.7–5.0).

Using these:

- **Typical per‑person effective consumption/income:**  
  – **≈ \$13,256/year ≈ \$1,105/month (PPP)**.  
- **Typical 5‑person household consumption/income:**  
  – 13,256 × 5 ≈ **\$66,280/year PPP** → **≈ \$5,520/month PPP**.

Converted back to local currency (rough PPP parity vs wages is rough, but using nominal FX ≈49 EGP/\$ as a guide):

- **Indicative median‑type household cash equivalent:**  
  – **≈ 270,000–300,000 EGP/year** → **≈ 22,500–25,000 EGP/month** in real purchasing‑power terms.

In **nominal EGP**, given the high inflation and devaluation, many middle‑class households are closer to **20,000–30,000 EGP/month** if they have **two formal earners** (e.g., two workers each on ~8–15k EGP).

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

The most recent harmonised estimates show:

- **Gini coefficient (disposable income, 2024):** **0.28** [7].  

Context:

- **Similar** to many middle‑income countries,  
- **More equal** than some Latin‑American cases (0.45–0.50),  
- **Less equal** than the most egalitarian European states (~0.25).

However, research suggests **top incomes may be under‑captured**, so real inequality could be somewhat higher than 0.28.

### 2.3 Poverty – levels, thresholds and dynamics  

**National poverty line:**

- **Official 2019/20 poverty headcount (CAPMAS):** **29.7 %** of Egyptians poor [2].  
- **World Bank Poverty & Equity brief (2021):** **33.5 %** poor using national methodology [3].  
- **Independent 2023 estimate (Manassa, based on CAPMAS experts):** **≈ 35.7 %** poor [8].  

**Poverty thresholds (updated for devaluation):**

CAPMAS’ official 2019/20 thresholds [8]:

- For a **4‑person household**:
  - Poverty line: **3,428 EGP/month**,  
  - Extreme poverty line: **2,200 EGP/month**.

Given the pound devaluation (from ~15.7 EGP/\$ in 2020 to ~50.5 EGP/\$ in 2025) [8]:

- Manassa estimates **2025‑equivalent thresholds** roughly as:
  - **Current poverty line for four‑person family:** **≈ 11,000 EGP/month**,  
  - **Extreme poverty line:** **> 7,000 EGP/month** [8].

Importantly:

> The **current extreme‑poverty line is now above the statutory minimum wage (7,000 EGP)**, meaning many full‑time minimum‑wage earners are classified as **extremely poor** by CAPMAS’ own updated real‑price criteria.

**Global poverty lines (World Bank, 2021 PPP):**

- Poverty at **\$4.20/day**: **~7 %** of population [2].  
- At **\$8.30/day:** **~59 %** of population [2].  

So:

- **Severe/extreme poverty** at very low global lines is limited (single‑digit %),  
- But **vulnerability & lower‑middle poverty** at **\$8.30/day** covers **more than half** the population.

## 3. Egypt’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Levels, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person  

From IMF/Worldometers (2025):

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:** **\$349.26 billion** [12].  
- **Population, mid‑2025:** **118,365,995** [13].  

→ **Nominal GDP per capita:**

\[
\approx \$3,191\text{/person/year}
\]

### 3.2 GDP per capita – PPP  

IMF WEO DataMapper (PPP) [9]:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:** **≈ \$21,760** (thousand int.\$ per person).  

So:

> The Egyptian economy produces about **\$3,200 per person per year at market prices**, but about **\$21–22k per person per year in PPP terms**, once lower local prices are factored in.

### 3.3 Real GDP growth  

IMF/press extracts:

- **Real GDP growth, FY 2024:** **≈ 2.4 %**.  
- **Real GDP growth, FY 2025:** **≈ 4.3 %** (IMF forecast and 2025 reporting) [6][15].  

This is **solid recovery**, driven by:

- **Manufacturing**,  
- **Construction and infrastructure**,  
- **Tourism and Suez Canal revenues**,  
- Some **energy** and **renewables**.

### 3.4 Inflation  

CBE and TradingEconomics:

- **Urban CPI inflation, Dec 2025:** **≈ 12.3 % YoY** [3].  
- Earlier in 2025, figures around **10–13 %** were common.  
- **Core CPI** (stripping food & energy) also around **11.8–12.5 %** [3].

This is **down from 30 %+ spikes** in 2023, but still **very high**, eroding purchasing power.

### 3.5 Labour market – unemployment  

CAPMAS and macro databases:

- **Unemployment rate, Q2 2025:** **6.1 %**.  
- **Unemployment rate, Q3 2025:** **6.4 %** [16].  

IMF’s broader unemployment estimate:

- **2025 annual average unemployment:** **≈ 7.3–7.4 %** [16].  

Youth unemployment (15–24) remains **well above 15 %**, commonly cited around **18–20 %**.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Side‑by‑side snapshot (≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate value |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$3,191/year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **≈ \$21,760/year** |
| **Median gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 7,800 EGP/month ≈ \$155–160/month** |
| **Average gross wage (CAPMAS)** | **≈ 5,005 EGP/month ≈ \$100–105/month** |
| **Statutory minimum wage (private sector)** | **7,000 EGP/month ≈ \$140–145/month** |
| **Per‑capita household consumption (PPP)** | **\$13,256/year ≈ \$1,105/month** |
| **Average household size** | **≈ 4.7–5.0 people** |
| **Gini coefficient (income)** | **≈ 0.28** |
| **Poverty (national line)** | **≈ 30–36 % of population** |
| **Poverty at \$4.20/day PPP** | **≈ 7 %** |
| **Poverty at \$8.30/day PPP** | **≈ 59 %** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 6.1–6.4 % (quarterly), ≈ 7.3–7.4 % (annual)** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 12.3 % (Dec 2025 YoY)** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 4.3 % (FY 2025)** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps  

1. **GDP per head vs wages**  
   - **PPP GDP per person (~\$21,760)** is **an order of magnitude higher** than the **typical worker’s cash income (~\$1,900/year)**.  
   - Reasons:
     - GDP includes **corporate profits (including state‑owned enterprises)**, not just wages.  
     - GDP/head is divided across **children, non‑workers, and retirees**, not just employees.  
     - PPP GDP uses **price levels**, inflating the apparent purchasing power relative to nominal EGP cash incomes.

2. **Median vs mean wages and informality**  
   - CAPMAS’ **average wage (5,005 EGP)** is **lower than survey‑based medians**; this strongly indicates:
     - Lots of **very low‑paid and part‑time jobs**,  
     - Many jobs with **incomplete reporting** (part of pay in cash or in‑kind, not on payroll),  
     - A large **informal sector**.

3. **Minimum wage vs poverty lines**  
   - The **minimum wage of 7,000 EGP** is now **below the extreme‑poverty threshold** for a 4‑person household (~7,000 EGP) and **far below the updated poverty line (~11,000 EGP)** [8].  
   - Thus, a **single full‑time minimum‑wage earner** supporting a family of four is **officially poor** and often **extremely poor** in real‑price terms.

4. **Household structure and dual‑earner dependence**  
   - With **average households near 5 persons**, a single median earner (~7,800 EGP/month) is **insufficient** to keep the family above the **real poverty line**.  
   - Middle‑class stability generally requires:
     - **Two earners**, or  
     - **Additional income** (small business, rent, remittances), or  
     - **Subsidies and transfers**.

5. **Inequality vs poverty**  
   - A **Gini of ~0.28** suggests **moderate inequality**, but:
     - **30–36 %** of Egyptians are poor by national standards,  
     - **~59 %** fall below \$8.30/day PPP.  
   - This means **a large mass of low‑ and lower‑middle‑income households**, clustered just around the poverty line, while **extremely rich groups are relatively small** but influential.

6. **Inflation pressure**  
   - Even with **4.3 % real GDP growth**, inflation around **12 %** means:
     - **Nominal wage increases** are quickly **eroded**,  
     - Real incomes for lower‑income households often **stagnate or decline**, especially where wages are not indexed.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Egypt, ≈2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross monthly income (EGP)

Use these rough bands to place a worker in Egypt’s distribution:

- **< 3,000 EGP/month (≲ \$60)**  
  – Very low income; typical of **casual labor, some agricultural work, informal domestic jobs**. Unable to support a family.

- **3,000–6,000 EGP/month (≈ \$60–120)**  
  – **Lower‑middle tier**; junior clerical roles, basic services, many private‑sector workers; often **near or below poverty** if the person is a sole earner.

- **6,000–9,000 EGP/month (≈ \$120–180)**  
  – Around the **median‑type formal wage**; typical for many full‑time employees in cities. One such income cannot comfortably support a 4–5 person household.

- **9,000–15,000 EGP/month (≈ \$180–300)**  
  – **Core middle‑class**; many mid‑career professionals, public‑sector officers, teachers in good schools, experienced technicians.

- **> 15,000 EGP/month (≳ \$300)**  
  – **Upper‑middle to high income** nationally; senior managers, IT/finance specialists, successful private‑sector professionals.

### 5.2 Household net monthly income (≈5‑person household)

Anchoring to updated poverty thresholds and typical consumption:

- **< 11,000 EGP/month (≲ \$220)**  
  – **Below national poverty line** for a typical 4–5 person family; likely experiencing **food and education insecurity**.

- **11,000–20,000 EGP/month (≈ \$220–400)**  
  – **Low‑ to lower‑middle‑income**; basics can be covered in cheaper areas but **no real buffer** against shocks; rent and healthcare costs are heavy burdens.

- **20,000–30,000 EGP/month (≈ \$400–600)**  
  – **Broad middle class**; can afford modest housing, schooling, and some savings; typical for two median earners or one stronger formal income plus side earnings.

- **> 30,000 EGP/month (≳ \$600)**  
  – **Upper‑middle/affluent**; strong resilience, capacity to save, pay for private schooling/healthcare, and build assets.

---

## 6. Short “Egypt 2025” Snapshot  

Around **2025**, **Egypt** is a **large, lower‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP per person around \$3,200** and **PPP GDP per head near \$21,800**. A **typical full‑time formal worker** earns roughly **7,800 EGP/month** (≈ **\$160/month**), while **official average wages** across all employees are lower at **≈ 5,000 EGP/month**, reflecting widespread **low‑pay and informality**. The **statutory minimum wage** for the private sector, **7,000 EGP/month**, now **barely reaches or even falls below updated national extreme‑poverty thresholds** for a four‑person family, so **many full‑time minimum‑wage workers are still poor**.  

Households typically contain **around five members**, and **per‑capita consumption** is about **\$13,256/year PPP**, implying that a median household of this size needs **20,000–30,000 EGP/month** to achieve a secure middle‑class standard. Yet **30–36 %** of Egyptians are poor by national definitions, and **around 59 %** live below **\$8.30/day PPP**, in a context of **moderate measured inequality (Gini ≈ 0.28)** but **very high inflation (~12 %)** and **unemployment around 6–7 %**, with youth unemployment near **20 %**.  

In short, **headline GDP and growth numbers look reasonable**, but **low wages, high inflation, and large household sizes** mean that for a large share of Egyptians, **living standards remain fragile**, with many families hovering near or below the poverty line despite working full‑time.
