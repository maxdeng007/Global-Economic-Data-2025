# United Arab Emirates around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **UAE “turn”**, in line with the country profiles you already have.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in the UAE (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage  

Recent Dubai‑ and UAE‑wide salary syntheses give a good central benchmark:

- **Median gross monthly salary (full‑time worker, 2025):**  
  **≈ 13,800 AED / month** (≈ **US\$3,760 / month**, **≈ US\$45,000 / year**) [4].  

Assuming ≈165 working hours/month:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**  
  13,800 ÷ 165 ≈ **84 AED/hour** → **≈ US\$23/hour**.

This sits close to most “typical salary in the UAE” ranges (12,000–15,000 AED) published by major salary guides.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

- **Average gross monthly salary (UAE, 2025):**  
  **≈ 15,000 AED / month** (≈ **US\$4,100 / month**, **≈ US\$50,000 / year**) [1].  
- In Dubai specifically, multiple sources cluster around **≈ 15,700–18,000 AED / month** [1][4].

Comparison:

- **Median ≈ 13,800 AED**,  
- **Mean ≈ 15,000–16,000 AED**.  

So the **average is only about 8–10 % higher than the median**, indicating a **moderately skewed** (but not extreme) wage distribution.

### 1.3 Minimum wage – legal and de‑facto floors  

There is **no single statutory national minimum wage for expatriates**, but:

- **For Emirati citizens in the private sector (2025):**  
  - Minimum wage: **5,000 AED / month** [6].  
  - It is legislated to rise to **6,000 AED** from **1 January 2026** [6].  

- **For most expatriates (visa rules & practice):**  
  - Typical **minimum salary for work‑visa sponsorship**: **4,000 AED / month**,  
  - Or **3,000 AED + employer‑provided accommodation** [5].  
  - Many entry‑level jobs in retail, hospitality and construction cluster around **4,500–6,000 AED / month**.

Relative to the median‑type wage:

- **5,000 AED ≈ 36 % of the median 13,800 AED**,  
- **6,000 AED (from 2026) ≈ 43 % of the median**,  
- **4,000 AED ≈ 29 % of the median**.

In practice:

> A **full‑time Emirati on the 2025 minimum** earns about **one‑third of a typical worker’s pay**; many low‑paid expatriates sit in the **4–6k AED/month band**, which is tight in Dubai/Abu Dhabi once rent is included.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

Legal framework and surveys show:

- Since 2020, UAE law requires **equal pay for men and women for the same work or work of equal value** in both **public and private sectors** [9].  
- Nonetheless, labour‑market studies and GCC salary reports indicate that:
  - Women in the UAE on average earn **≈ 15–20 % less than men**,  
  - After adjusting for occupation, experience and education, the gap narrows to about **6–8 %** [9].

Drivers:

- Under‑representation of women in **top‑paying executive and technical roles**,  
- Occupational segregation into mid‑pay sectors like education, healthcare, and support services.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage contrasts  

Using Cooper Fitch’s *UAE Salary Guide 2025* and composite market surveys [5][4]:

**High‑pay sectors (monthly, AED, mid–senior):**

- **Banking & Finance, Investment Management:**
  - Investment Manager: **≈ 47,000 AED**.  
  - Chief Investment Officer: **≈ 88,000 AED**.  
  - Heads of private banking / corporate banking: **70,000–100,000+ AED**.

- **Technology & Digital:**
  - Chief Digital / Information / Security Officer: **≈ 88,000–99,000 AED**.  
  - Senior engineers, architects, data scientists: **≈ 40,000–60,000 AED**.

- **Real Estate & Major Projects:**
  - Chief Development Officer or Chief Projects Officer: **≈ 100,000–130,000+ AED**.  
  - Senior development / programme directors: **≈ 60,000–90,000+ AED**.

**Mid‑range sectors:**

- **Public sector, education, mid‑level healthcare, mid‑management:**
  - Managers and senior analysts in ministries and public entities: **≈ 16,000–30,000 AED**.  
  - Teachers, mid‑career nurses, mid‑level engineers: **≈ 15,000–30,000 AED**.

**Lower‑pay sectors:**

- **Hospitality / tourism, retail, low‑skill construction and services:**
  - Staff and junior supervisors: **≈ 4,500–12,000 AED**.  

**Regional pattern:**

- **Dubai** wages are typically **10–15 % above** national averages,  
- **Abu Dhabi** slightly above for energy‑related roles,  
- **Sharjah, Ajman, RAK, Fujairah** often **5–15 % below** Dubai levels, but with **lower housing costs**.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Per‑capita and household disposable income  

A 2025 cross‑country comparison of **real disposable income per capita** (PPP) ranks the UAE as follows:

- **Real disposable income per capita, 2025 (PPP):**  
  **US\$22,200 / person / year** [10].  

Using the fixed peg **1 US\$ ≈ 3.67 AED**:

- **≈ 22,200 × 3.67 ≈ 81,500 AED / person / year**,  
- **≈ 6,800 AED / person / month**.

Average household size:

- Dubai data for 2024–25: **≈ 4 persons per household** [11].  
- Nationally, estimates are in the **4–5 range**; using 4 is a conservative middle‑class benchmark.

Thus a rough **median‑type** household picture:

- **Median‑type household disposable income:**  
  – 6,800 × 4 ≈ **27,200 AED / month** → **≈ US\$7,400 / month**, **≈ US\$88,800 / year**.

This aligns well with:

- **Typical dual‑earner expatriate families** (each earning 12–17k AED),  
- **Upper‑middle Emirati households** with supplementary state benefits and rents.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

Available data points:

- **World Bank / CEIC Gini index (2014):** **32.5 (0–100)** → **0.325 on 0–1 scale** [12].  
- WorldPopulationReview and CIA Factbook report similar **≈ 26–30** for 2018–2020 [15][16].

Interpretation:

- The UAE’s **Gini (~0.30–0.33)** indicates **moderate income inequality**:
  - **More equal** than many emerging economies,  
  - **Less equal** than top Nordic countries (≈0.25–0.28).  
- Inequality is driven more by **vertical dispersion (high‑paid expat professionals vs low‑paid expat workers)** than by citizens vs citizens; Emirati households themselves are relatively compressed at mid‑to‑high income levels.

### 2.3 Poverty thresholds and incidence  

The UAE has **no official national poverty line**, but using **relative poverty (50 % of median equivalised income)**:

- **Median per‑capita disposable income:** 6,800 AED / month.  
- **50 % threshold (per person):** **≈ 3,400 AED / month**.  
- **4‑person household poverty line:** **≈ 13,600 AED / month** (≈ **US\$3,700 / month**).

CEIC / World Bank data for **“proportion below 50 % of median income”** show:

- **2018:** **≈ 9.1 %** of people below 50 % of median income [13].  
- Earlier (2013): **≈ 19.3 %**, so substantial improvement.

Given **strong GDP growth**, **rising wages** and **continued welfare support**, a cautious 2025 judgement is:

> Around **7–9 % of the UAE population** can be considered **income‑poor in relative terms**, but **extreme poverty (global \$3/day thresholds) is essentially zero.**

Groups at higher risk:

- Low‑wage expatriate families supporting dependants in the UAE,  
- Some single‑earner households in high‑rent areas,  
- Marginalized non‑citizens with irregular employment.

## 3. UAE’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per capita  

IMF / World Bank‑based figures for **2025** [1][14]:

- **Total nominal GDP:**  
  – **≈ US\$550 billion**.  
- **Population (mid‑2025):**  
  – **≈ 11.2 million**.  

Thus:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \approx \frac{550\text{ bn}}{11.2\text{ m}} \approx \textbf{US\$49,000–55,000 / person / year}
\]

PPP side:

- **PPP GDP per capita (2025f):** ≈ **US\$100,000–102,000 / person / year** [1].

So:

> In simple terms, the UAE produces roughly **US\$50–55k of output per person at market prices**, which corresponds to around **US\$100k per person** in purchasing‑power terms.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth  

Central Bank of the UAE – Quarterly Economic Review, Sep 2025 [2]:

- **Real GDP growth, Q1 2025:** **+3.9 % YoY**.  
- **Non‑hydrocarbon GDP growth, Q1 2025:** **+5.3 % YoY**.  
- **Full‑year 2025 forecast (overall):** **+4.9 % real GDP growth**.  

Hydrocarbon sector:

- Expected growth **≈ 5.8 %** in 2025;  
Non‑hydrocarbon:

- **≈ 4.5 %** in 2025.

### 3.3 Inflation  

Same source [2]:

- **Headline inflation, Q2 2025:** **0.6 % YoY**.  
- **Full‑year inflation forecast, 2025:** **1.5 %** (revised down from 1.9 %).  
- **2026 forecast:** **≈ 1.8 %**.

Thus:

> The UAE enters 2026 with **low and stable inflation near 1.5–2.0 %**, after moderating from the higher global inflation of 2022.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment  

Macro data and forecasts [3][17]:

- **Unemployment rate (2023):** **≈ 2.15 %**.  
- **Unemployment forecast, 2025:** **≈ 2.2 %** [3].  
- Government statements in late 2025 note a **headline unemployment of ≈ 1.9 %**, among the **lowest globally** [17].

This indicates a **very tight labour market**:

- High employment rates and sustained demand for qualified expatriate labour,  
- Underemployment and informality are less of a structural issue than in most middle‑income countries.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key figures side‑by‑side  

| Metric (≈2025) | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **≈ US\$49–55k / person / year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **≈ US\$100–102k / person / year** |
| **Median full‑time wage (gross)** | **≈ 13,800 AED / month ≈ US\$3,760 / month** |
| **Average full‑time wage (gross)** | **≈ 15,000–16,000 AED / month ≈ US\$4,100–4,400 / month** |
| **Minimum wage (Emirati, private sector)** | **5,000 AED / month (2025)** |
| **Typical expatriate entry‑level wage** | **≈ 4,500–6,000 AED / month** |
| **Real disposable income per capita (PPP)** | **≈ US\$22,200 / year ≈ 6,800 AED / month** |
| **Median household disposable income (4 persons)** | **≈ 27,200 AED / month** |
| **Relative poverty threshold (50 % of median)** | **≈ 3,400 AED / person / month; ≈ 13,600 AED for 4‑person household** |
| **Population below 50 % median (2018)** | **≈ 9.1 %** |
| **Gini coefficient (income)** | **≈ 0.30–0.33** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 2.0–2.2 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 1.5 % (2025)** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 4.9 % (2025)** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps  

1. **GDP vs wages vs incomes**  
   - **GDP per capita (~US\$50–55k)** is higher than a **typical worker’s cash pay (~US\$45–50k)** and more than double the **average per‑capita disposable income (~US\$22k)**.  
   - The difference reflects:
     - **Corporate profits** and **oil rents**,  
     - **Taxes and government revenue**,  
     - **Public consumption and investment**,  
     - GDP being averaged over **children, retirees, non‑workers**, not just wage‑earners.

2. **Mean vs median wages**  
   - With **mean wages ≈ 15–16k AED** and **median ≈ 13.8k AED**, the **average is only modestly above the middle**, compared with countries where mean/median ratios can be 1.5–2.  
   - However, **upper‑tier executives** earning **50–100k+ AED/month** and **low‑tier workers** at **4–6k AED** create a **dual‑tier labour market** by occupation and nationality.

3. **Household income and poverty**  
   - A **median‑type household** has about **27k AED/month** to live on; in Dubai, this supports a **solid but not lavish middle‑class standard** if renting family housing.  
   - Households below **≈ 13.6k AED/month (4‑person)** are considered **income‑poor** by relative standards; they make up **perhaps 7–9 % of the population**, concentrated among **low‑skill expatriate workers** and some lower‑income Emiratis.  
   - **Extreme poverty** (by global \$3/day lines) is effectively zero.

4. **Macro vs micro experience**  
   - With **4.9 % real GDP growth**, **≈2 % unemployment** and **1.5 % inflation**, macro indicators look **exceptionally strong**.  
   - Yet **high housing, schooling and healthcare costs** in top emirates mean that **workers in the 4–8k AED/month band** experience **tight budgets**, particularly if they support dependants in the UAE rather than abroad.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (UAE 2025)

### 5.1 Individuals – gross monthly income (AED)

- **< 4,000 AED/month**  
  – Very low by UAE standards; often **entry‑level or partial hours**; unsustainable for independent living in major emirates.

- **4,000–8,000 AED/month**  
  – **Lower‑income tier**; common for basic retail, hospitality, manual work; budget is tight once rent is included.

- **8,000–14,000 AED/month**  
  – **Lower‑ to mid‑middle**; around or below the **national median (13.8k)**; typical for many junior professionals, teachers, technicians.

- **14,000–25,000 AED/month**  
  – **Core middle‑class**; comfortable for singles and couples; adequate for a family with careful budgeting.

- **25,000–50,000 AED/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle**; experienced professionals and managers; strong capacity to save, invest, and maintain a high standard of living.

- **> 50,000 AED/month**  
  – **High income**; senior executives, partners, top specialists; among the top few percent of earners.

### 5.2 Households – net monthly income (≈4 people)

- **< 14,000 AED/month**  
  – **Low‑income / near‑poverty**; often single‑earner; difficult to cover good housing, schooling and transport in major cities.

- **14,000–22,000 AED/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle**; basics covered, but vulnerable to shocks and high rent.

- **22,000–35,000 AED/month**  
  – **Broad middle**; typical dual‑earner expat family; can afford reasonable housing and some savings.

- **35,000–50,000 AED/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle**; comfortable lifestyle, private schooling and regular savings.

- **> 50,000 AED/month**  
  – **Affluent**; property ownership, frequent travel, and robust wealth‑building opportunities.

## 6. Short “UAE 2025” Snapshot  

By **2025**, the **United Arab Emirates** is a **high‑income, fast‑growing economy** with **nominal GDP per person around US\$50–55k** and **PPP GDP per capita near US\$100k**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **13,800 AED/month** (≈ **US\$45k/year**), while the **average wage** is slightly higher at **15–16k AED/month**. There is no national minimum wage for expatriates, but **Emirati citizens have a 5,000 AED/month floor** in the private sector, and **visa rules effectively keep most expatriate wages above 4,000 AED/month**.  

Household data suggest **real disposable income per person around US\$22,200/year** (≈ **6,800 AED/month**), implying a **median four‑person household** lives on **≈ 27k AED/month**, while **relative poverty** is centred below **≈ 13.6k AED/month** for such a household and affects **roughly 7–9 % of residents**. Income inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.30–0.33)**, but the labour market is sharply segmented between **high‑pay professional roles and low‑pay service work**. With **real GDP growing nearly 5 %**, **unemployment around 2 %** and **inflation near 1.5 %**, the UAE’s macroeconomic conditions are exceptionally favourable; nonetheless, **workers in the 4–8k AED range and lower‑income households in high‑rent cities face tight budgets**, making the generous national averages feel distant from their day‑to‑day reality.
