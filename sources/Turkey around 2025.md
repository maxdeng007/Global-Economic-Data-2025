# Turkey around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Turkey “turn”**, structured like your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Turkey (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage  

Best central benchmark from recent 2025 labour and salary reports:

- **Median net monthly salary (all employees, 2025):**  
  **≈ 34,900 TRY/month** – “typical worker” take‑home pay [1].  
  - ≈ **US\$ 880/month**, using an average 2025 FX of **≈ 39.6 TRY per US\$** [2].  
  - ≈ **US\$ 10,500/year** (12 months).

Assuming ≈165 working hours/month:

- **Median net hourly wage:**  
  34,900 ÷ 165 ≈ **212 TRY/hour** ≈ **US\$ 5.3/hour**.

Given Turkey’s employee social‑security and tax deductions, this implies a **median‑type gross wage** roughly:

- **Median gross monthly wage (est.):**  
  **≈ 40,000 TRY/month** ≈ **US\$ 1,010/month**  
  → **≈ US\$ 12,000/year**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

Combining national statistics and private salary compendia:

- **Average gross monthly wage (full‑time, 2024–25):**  
  **≈ 40,000–45,000 TRY/month** [3][4].  
  - ≈ **US\$ 1,010–1,140/month** → **US\$ 12,000–13,500/year**.

The mean sits only about **10–15 % above the median** (40–45k vs ~40k), meaning:

> Turkey’s wage distribution is **somewhat skewed upwards** by high earners, but not as dramatically as in very high‑inequality economies where the mean can be 50–100 % above the median.

### 1.3 Minimum wage  

Turkey has a single nationwide statutory minimum wage:

- **Gross monthly minimum wage (from 1 Jan 2025):**  
  **26,005.50 TRY/month** [5].  
  - ≈ **US\$ 660/month** at ~39.6 TRY/US\$.  

- **Net minimum wage (after taxes and contributions, 2025):**  
  **≈ 22,104.67 TRY/month** [6].  
  - ≈ **US\$ 560/month**.

Relative to central benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median gross wage:**  
  26,005.5 / 40,000 ≈ **65 %**.  
- **Minimum vs average gross wage (~42,500):**  
  ≈ **61 %**.

So:

> A full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns **around two‑thirds** of a typical formal worker’s gross pay, but in practice this is often **insufficient to cover a three‑person household’s basic needs**, especially in large cities.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

There is no single official 2025 headline number, but converging evidence from ILO, TÜİK and research:

- **Unadjusted gender pay gap:** most studies find women earning **≈ 15–20 % less** than men on average, i.e. women’s wages around **80–85 % of men’s**.  
- **Adjusted gap (same occupation, age, education etc.):** recent ILO–TÜİK work puts this around **5–8 %** – women still earn **slightly less** than comparable men [2][7].

The gap is:

- **Wider** for women with **lower education** and in **informal work**,  
- **Narrower** among higher‑educated formal employees, but still present.

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage differences  

Using the 2025 Turkey salary analysis [3] plus sectoral snapshots:

**By sector (net monthly salary ranges, 2025) [3]:**

- **IT & Software (developers, analysts):**  
  – **50,000–100,000+ TRY/month** (≈ **US\$ 1,260–2,520+**).  
- **Finance & Banking (accountants, auditors, consultants):**  
  – **35,000–70,000 TRY/month** (≈ **US\$ 880–1,770**).  
- **Engineering (construction, mechanical, etc.):**  
  – **30,000–55,000 TRY/month** (≈ **US\$ 760–1,390**).  
- **Marketing & Sales (experienced managers):**  
  – **25,000–50,000 TRY/month**.  
- **Healthcare:**  
  – Specialist doctors (private clinics): **60,000–120,000 TRY/month** (≈ **US\$ 1,520–3,030**).  
  – Nurses: **20,000–30,000 TRY/month** (≈ **US\$ 510–760**).  
- **Teachers & Educators:**  
  – Public schools: **25,000–35,000 TRY/month**.  
  – Private/international schools: **40,000–70,000 TRY/month**.  
- **Logistics & Transport:**  
  – Supply‑chain/logistics professionals: **35,000–60,000 TRY/month**.  
  – Long‑haul truck drivers: **30,000–50,000 TRY/month**.  
  – Taxi drivers (Istanbul): **20,000–35,000 TRY/month**.

**By region (net monthly averages, 2025) [3]:**

- **Istanbul:** **35,000–45,000 TRY** – highest pay, highest costs.  
- **Ankara:** **30,000–38,000 TRY**.  
- **Izmir:** **28,000–36,000 TRY**.  
- **Industrial hubs (Bursa, Kocaeli, Gaziantep):** **25,000–32,000 TRY**.  
- **Tourism regions (Antalya, Muğla):** **25,000–35,000 TRY** but highly seasonal.  
- **Eastern & Central Anatolia:** **18,000–25,000 TRY**, the lowest ranges.

**Interpretation:**  

> A mid‑career IT or finance professional in Istanbul on **60–80k TRY/month** may earn **3–4x** what a service‑sector worker in Eastern Anatolia does, despite both working full‑time.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household and per‑person disposable income  

From TÜİK’s **Income Distribution Statistics 2025** and related analyses:

- **Mean annual household disposable income (2025):**  
  **662,414 TRY/year** – up **76.7 %** over 2024 [8].  
  → ≈ **US\$ 16,740/year** at ≈ 39.6 TRY/US\$.  

- Given an **average household size ≈ 3.2 persons**, this implies:

  \[
  \text{Mean per‑capita disposable income} \approx 662{,}414 / 3.2 \approx 206{,}000\ \text{TRY/year} \approx 17{,}200\ \text{TRY/month}
  \]

- International comparisons of **real disposable income per capita (PPP, 2025)** rank Turkey at:

  - **≈ US\$ 24,100 per person per year** (≈ **US\$ 2,010/month PPP**) [3].

**Median vs mean:**  

- TÜİK does not publish a single headline “median household income” figure for 2025, but given the **Gini (0.41)** and high top‑income concentration, the **median household income** is **substantially below the mean**. A reasonable approximation is:

  - **Median household disposable income:**  
    **≈ 400,000 TRY/year** (≈ **33,000 TRY/month**, ≈ **US\$ 10,100/year**).

> So a **“typical” household of 3–3.2 persons** likely lives on **≈ 30–35k TRY/month net**, while the **average (mean) household** is pulled upwards by high earners to **≈ 55k TRY/month**.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

TÜİK’s **Income Distribution Statistics 2025**:

- **Gini coefficient (equivalised disposable income, 2025):**  
  **0.410**, down slightly from **0.413** in 2024 [4][8].  

Other analyses confirm:

- The top **20 % of households** capture roughly **48 % of total income**,  
- The bottom **20 %** receive under **7 %** of total income [8].

Comparatively:

- **More unequal** than the EU average (≈0.29–0.31),  
- **Among the most unequal** large upper‑middle‑income economies, though **less extreme** than classic Latin‑American outliers.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and rates  

**Official relative poverty** (TÜİK, 2025):

- **Relative poverty line (60 % of median equivalised income):**  

  While TÜİK uses annual equivalised income, trade‑union and think‑tank work translate this into **monthly “hunger” and “poverty” thresholds**:

  - **Hunger threshold (food‑only minimum, August 2025):**  
    **26,149 TRY/month** [9].  
  - **Poverty line (full basic‑needs basket, August 2025):**  
    **90,450 TRY/month** [9].  

  For a typical 4‑person household, this means **needing nearly 100,000 TRY/month** to avoid economic deprivation [10].

- **Relative poverty rate (income < 60 % of median, 2025):**  
  – **13.0 %** of the population [5].  

- **Persistent at‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (poor for multiple years, 2025):**  
  – **13.6 %**, slightly lower than in 2024 [1].

**Material and social deprivation (EU‑style indicators, 2025):**

- **Severe material & social deprivation rate, 2025:**  
  – Fell from **13.3 %** (2024) to **11.9 %** [5].

**Extreme poverty and welfare statistics:**

- Ministry and press reports suggest **nearly 12 million people** (≈ **14 %** of the population) live in conditions that can be classed as **“extreme poverty”** – with very low or no formal income and heavy reliance on assistance [6].

> In practical terms, **roughly 1 in 7 people** in Turkey are **income‑poor** by national relative standards, and a somewhat similar share face **serious material deprivation**.

## 3. Turkey’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per capita  

From the IMF and Worldometers 2025 tables [7][8]:

- **Population (2025):** ≈ **87.7 million**.  
- **Nominal GDP per capita (2025):**  
  – **US\$ 18,198/person/year**.  
- **GDP per capita, PPP (2025):**  
  – **≈ US\$ 43,700–44,000/person/year**.

So:

> Turkey generates roughly **US\$ 18k of market‑price output per person per year**, equivalent to **about US\$ 44k per person** when adjusted for lower local prices (PPP).

### 3.2 Real GDP growth  

Multiple 2025 macro sources (IMF, World Bank, Turkish Ministry of Trade):

- **Real GDP growth 2024:** ≈ **3.2–3.3 %**.  
- **Real GDP growth 2025:**  
  - **≈ 3.5 %** according to Worldometers/IMF summary [7].  
  - World Bank and private‑sector forecasts cluster between **3.5–4 %** [9][11].

### 3.3 Inflation  

From TÜİK CPI and TradingEconomics [10]:

- **Annual CPI inflation, June 2025:** **+35.05 %** YoY.  
- **Annual CPI inflation, January 2025:** **+42.12 %** YoY.  
- **Annual CPI inflation, December 2025:** **30.89 % YoY** – the lowest reading in several years but still extremely high [10].

Monetary‑policy commentary (ING, İşbank, TCMB) emphasises:

- **Inflation is disinflating** from the **50–60 %** zone towards the **30 %** range,  
- **End‑2025 expectations for 2026** still see inflation **> 20 %**, so price stability remains remote.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment  

From TÜİK’s Labour Force Statistics and macro data [11]:

- **Seasonally‑adjusted unemployment (Jan–Nov 2025):**  
  – Hovered between **8.4 % and 8.6 %**, with **8.5 % in October 2025** and **8.6 % in November 2025**.  

Breakdown:

- **Male unemployment:** ≈ **6.8–7 %**.  
- **Female unemployment:** ≈ **11.5–12 %**.  

Analysis of Q3 2025 data highlights:

- **High labour under‑utilisation** – many people in **short‑hours, low‑pay or informal jobs**,  
- Stagnant job creation relative to population growth, even as official unemployment inches down slightly [11][12].

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key metrics side‑by‑side (Turkey ≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate level |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **US\$ 18,200/year** |
| **GDP per capita, PPP** | **≈ US\$ 44,000/year** |
| **Median net wage (individual)** | **34,900 TRY/month ≈ US\$ 880/month ≈ US\$ 10.5k/year** |
| **Median gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 40,000 TRY/month ≈ US\$ 1,010/month ≈ US\$ 12k/year** |
| **Average gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 42–45k TRY/month ≈ US\$ 12–13.5k/year** |
| **Statutory gross minimum wage** | **26,005.5 TRY/month ≈ US\$ 660/month** |
| **Net minimum wage** | **≈ 22,100 TRY/month ≈ US\$ 560/month** |
| **Mean household disposable income** | **662,414 TRY/year ≈ US\$ 16.7k/year** |
| **Median household disposable income (est.)** | **≈ 400,000 TRY/year ≈ US\$ 10.1k/year** |
| **Real disposable income per capita (PPP)** | **≈ US\$ 24,100/year** |
| **Gini (disposable income)** | **≈ 0.41** |
| **Relative poverty rate (60 % median)** | **≈ 13.0 %** |
| **Unemployment rate (SA)** | **≈ 8.5–8.6 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, Dec 2025)** | **≈ 30.9 % YoY** |
| **Real GDP growth (2025)** | **≈ 3.5–3.7 %** |

### 4.2 Interpretation  

1. **GDP per head vs typical wages and incomes**  

- **Nominal GDP/head (~US\$ 18.2k)** exceeds the **median worker’s gross wage (~US\$ 12k)** and is roughly on par with the **average worker’s earnings (~US\$ 12–13.5k)**.  
- But **median household disposable income (~US\$ 10.1k/year)** and **median per‑capita income** are **significantly lower**, revealing how much of GDP is:
  - Captured as **profits** (private and state‑owned),  
  - Paid in **taxes and social contributions**,  
  - Allocated to **capital formation** rather than to current household consumption.

2. **Mean vs median – inequality in practice**  

- A mean household income of **662k TRY/year** vs a median closer to **400k TRY/year** shows that **top‑quintile incomes** pull the average up strongly.  
- The **top 20 %** capturing ~**48 %** of total income, vs the bottom 20 % with **< 7 %**, matches the **Gini ≈ 0.41** picture [8].  

3. **Wages vs cost‑of‑living and poverty thresholds**  

- By mid‑2025, the **family poverty line** is estimated at **≈ 90–100k TRY/month** for a typical four‑person household, while the **gross minimum wage is 26k TRY** and the **median net wage ≈ 35k TRY** [5][9][10].  
- This means:
  - A **single minimum‑wage earner** supporting a family is **deeply below the poverty threshold**.  
  - Even a **single median earner** plus a lower‑paid spouse may struggle to reach the **poverty line** in large cities, especially with high rent and food prices.

4. **High inflation and wage erosion**  

- 2025 inflation around **31 %** sharply erodes purchasing power.  
- Although wages and household incomes grew nominally by **50–75 %** between 2024 and 2025 (e.g., household incomes +76.7 %), **real gains are much smaller** once inflation is factored in.  
- Households at the bottom often see **rising debt and cuts in discretionary spending** just to keep up with food, energy and rent.

5. **Labour‑market slack and informality**  

- With **unemployment near 8.5–8.6 %** and **informality ≈ 30 %**, many people participate in the labour market only **intermittently or inefficiently**.  
- Under‑employment, unpaid family work and informal jobs mean that **household incomes are more fragile** than formal wage data alone suggests.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Turkey, ≈2025)

### 5.1 Individuals – gross monthly wage (TRY)

Use these bands to position a full‑time worker in the national distribution:

- **< 20,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Very low income**; often informal, part‑time, or early‑career service roles. Hard to live independently in major cities.  

- **20,000 – 35,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle**; common for junior office work, many public‑sector and retail jobs, and some skilled blue‑collar roles.  

- **35,000 – 50,000 TRY/month**  
  – Around and somewhat above the **median**; typical for experienced teachers, technicians, nurses, mid‑level office staff.  

- **50,000 – 80,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle**; mid‑career engineers, IT professionals, mid‑management, senior public‑sector professionals.  

- **> 80,000 TRY/month**  
  – **High income** nationally; senior managers, top specialists, expats, and successful entrepreneurs.

### 5.2 Households – net monthly income (≈3–4 persons)

Using poverty thresholds and mean/median income as anchors:

- **< 70,000 TRY/month**  
  – Often **near or below the hunger line** in urban areas; heavy financial stress.  

- **70,000 – 120,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but little buffer for rent spikes, health shocks or education costs.  

- **120,000 – 200,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Broad middle‑class**; can manage decent housing, schooling and some savings, especially outside Istanbul’s most expensive neighbourhoods.  

- **> 200,000 TRY/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle to affluent**; robust resilience and capacity to invest, travel and accumulate assets.

## 6. Short “Turkey 2025” Snapshot  

By **2025**, **Turkey** is a **large, upper‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP per capita around US\$ 18,200** and **PPP GDP per head close to US\$ 44,000**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **34,900 TRY/month net (≈ 40,000 TRY gross)** – roughly **US\$ 10.5–12k/year** – while **average wages** are slightly higher at **≈ 40–45k TRY/month**. The **statutory minimum wage** of **26,005.5 TRY/month gross (≈ 22,100 TRY net)** is about **60–65 % of typical earnings**, leaving many minimum‑wage workers well **below poverty‑line estimates** for a family.  

After taxes and transfers, the **mean household disposable income** is **662,414 TRY/year**, but the **median household** likely earns closer to **400,000 TRY/year**, reflecting a **Gini coefficient of 0.41** and a large top‑income tail. Around **13 %** of the population lives **below 60 % of median income**, and **11–12 %** face **severe material and social deprivation**, with millions effectively in **extreme poverty** by national hunger‑line standards.  

While **real GDP grows at about 3.5–3.7 %**, headline inflation remains **very high (~31 %)**, and **unemployment hovers around 8.5–8.6 %**, with pronounced regional and gender gaps and significant informality. Consequently, Turkey’s **strong GDP and export numbers** coexist with **tight household budgets**, particularly for low‑ and lower‑middle‑income families, making the lived experience of many Turks more precarious than the aggregate economic statistics alone might suggest.
