# Sweden around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the **Sweden “turn”**, aligned with the other country profiles in your history.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Sweden (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wages

Statistics Sweden (SCB) wage structure data for 2024 show:

- **Median gross monthly salary (all employees):** **34,400 SEK/month** [1].

Using a 2025 average exchange rate of **1 SEK ≈ 0.102 USD** (≈ **9.8 SEK per 1 USD**) [4]:

- 34,400 SEK/month ≈ **\$3,500/month**
- ≈ **\$42,000/year** (12 months).

Assuming ~165 hours/month:

- **Median hourly wage:**
  34,400 ÷ 165 ≈ **208 SEK/hour** ≈ **\$21/hour**.

So a **realistic “typical worker” benchmark** for 2025 is:

> **Median‑type full‑time salary (Sweden, 2025):**
> **≈ 34,000–35,000 SEK/month gross**
> → **≈ \$3,500–3,600/month**
> → **≈ \$42,000–43,000/year**
> → **≈ \$21/hour**.

Note: The Swedish Migration Agency uses a **median salary of 37,100 SEK/month (as of 17 June 2025)** to define “a good living” for work permits; **80 % of this is 29,680 SEK/month** [2]. That is consistent with a median slightly above the 34,400 SEK figure from the 2024 wage survey.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

Two complementary sources give a coherent range for the **mean**:

- **Monthly earnings in USD, Oct 2025 (CEIC):** **\$5,432/month** [5].
  – At ~0.102 USD per SEK, this is ≈ **53,150 SEK/month**.
- **Paylab aggregate:** **Total gross average salary:** **51,626 SEK/month** [3].

So:

> **Average (mean) gross wage (Sweden, ≈2025):**
> **≈ 52,000–54,000 SEK/month**
> → **≈ \$5,300–5,500/month**
> → **≈ \$64,000–66,000/year**.

The mean is **about 50 % higher than the median** (≈ 34,400 SEK), signaling a **substantial upper tail** of high‑earning professionals and executives.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Sweden is unusual in that it **has no statutory national minimum wage**:

- Wages – including minimum rates – are set in **sectoral collective agreements** negotiated between unions and employers [6].
- **Coverage**: about **90 % of workers** (≈ 100 % in the public sector; ≈ 80 % in the private sector) [6].

In practice:

- Many collective agreements in lower‑paid sectors specify **minimum full‑time wages** near **25,000–30,000 SEK/month** for adults (≈ **\$2,550–3,060**).
- These floors are **≈ 70–85 % of the median wage**, substantially higher (relative to median) than statutory minimums in many other countries.

Workers **outside collective‑agreement coverage** can technically be hired at lower rates, but this is relatively rare for standard full‑time jobs.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Several 2024–2025 sources describe the gender gap:

- A 2024 Swedish wage report finds **women’s mean monthly wage is 89.8 % of men’s**, i.e. a **raw (unadjusted) gap of about 10.2 %** [7].
- The **adjusted gender pay gap** (controlling for occupation, sector, age, etc.) is **≈ 6 %** – women earn about **94 % of men’s pay** for similar jobs [6].

So:

> In headline terms, women earn **about 10 % less** than men on average,
> and after adjustment for job characteristics, the remaining structural gap is **≈ 6 %**.

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences (broad)

Based on SCB occupational tables, Paylab and Swedish/expat salary guides:

- **High‑pay sectors:**
  - **Finance, banking, insurance, asset management**
    – Many mid‑career roles: **57,000–80,000 SEK/month** or more (≈ **\$5,800–8,200**).
  - **IT & software, data, engineering**
    – Common professional range: **55,000–75,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$5,600–7,700**).
  - **Senior management, consulting, pharma, specialist healthcare**
    – Often **80,000–100,000+ SEK/month** (≈ **\$8,200–10,200+**).

- **Mid‑range sectors:**
  - **Public administration, education, mid‑level healthcare**
  - **Manufacturing & skilled trades**
    – Typically **40,000–60,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$4,100–6,100**).

- **Lower‑pay sectors:**
  - **Hospitality (HORECA), retail, cleaning, basic care, some agriculture**
    – Often **25,000–35,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$2,550–3,600**), close to collective‑agreement floors.

**Regional variation** is moderate:

- **Stockholm and big metropolitan regions**: wages **≈ 10 % above** the national average for comparable roles.
- Smaller cities and rural areas: closer to or somewhat below the national medians, but with lower housing costs.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household disposable income

Two complementary vantage points:

1. **OECD 2025 survey (income level, 2022 data)**
   - **Median disposable household income (PPP, 2022):** **\$39,200 PPP per household** [8].
   - Converted roughly to SEK (using PPP parity ≈ 1.05 SEK per intl \$): **≈ 400,000 SEK/year**.

   With **average household size ≈ 2.2 persons**, this implies a **median per‑person disposable income** of around:

   \[
   \frac{400{,}000}{2.2} \approx 182{,}000\ \text{SEK/year} \approx \$17{,}300\ \text{PPP per person per year}
   \]

2. **Aggregate household income**
   - SCB and Statista show **average household disposable income** figures rising steadily; Statista’s 2025 forecast implies **per‑capita disposable income in the mid‑\$50k range in PPP terms** [10], indicating Sweden sits among the richer OECD countries.

**Interpretation:**

> A **typical Swedish household** lives on the order of **400–450k SEK per year net** (≈ **\$38–42k PPP**), which supports **2–3 people**. Per person, that is **≈ 180–200k SEK/year** in disposable income.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

The **Gini index** captures income dispersion:

- **World Bank Gini index (2023):** **29.3** (0–100 scale) → **0.293 on 0–1** [11].
- OECD reports a very similar **Gini ≈ 0.290** for 2022 [8].

Comparatively:

- **Less unequal** than the OECD average (**0.316**).
- On par with or slightly more equal than other Nordics.
- Much **more equal** than high‑inequality economies like the US or Brazil.

### 2.3 Poverty – relative and multidimensional

Several official indicators:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (EU 60 % of median income line):**
  – **14.8 % of the population (Dec 2024)** [12].

- **Relative poverty (OECD 50 % of median, 2022):**
  – **8.4 % of people** below 50 % of median equivalised income [8].

- **Multidimensional poverty (World Bank PIP, 2023):**
  – **1.63 %** [9] – very low, reflecting strong access to education, health and basic services.

So:

> Around **1 in 7 Swedes** has income **below 60 % of the national median**, and roughly **1 in 12** falls below the **stricter 50 % threshold**, but **severe poverty and deprivation remain rare**.

Groups at elevated risk:

- **Single‑person elderly households**,
- Some **migrant and refugee communities**,
- People with weak labour‑market attachment (long‑term unemployed, illness).

## 3. Sweden’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per person

From IMF/Wikipedia (IMF‑based) [13][14]:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **\$58,100**.
- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:** **\$74,900**.

Population:

- **End‑2025 population (SCB):** **10,592,700** residents [4].

Thus:

- **Nominal GDP 2025:** ~**\$615 billion**.
- **PPP GDP 2025:** ~**\$793 billion**.

In global rankings, Sweden sits in the **top tier** of GDP per capita, near or above many high‑income EU economies.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth

From SCB and CEIC:

- **Q2 2025:**
  – GDP up **0.5 % q/q (seasonally adjusted)**,
  – **+1.4 % y/y** (calendar‑adjusted) [15].
- **Q3 2025:**
  – **Real GDP growth +2.5 % y/y** [5].

European Commission forecasts real GDP growth **≈ 1.5 % for 2025** and **2.6 % for 2026** [16].

A reasonable **full‑year 2025** range:

> **Real GDP growth ≈ 1.5–2.0 %**, with momentum improving in the second half.

### 3.3 Inflation

From Statistics Sweden and macro trackers:

- **CPI inflation, November 2025:** **0.3 % y/y**.
- **CPI flash estimate, December 2025:** **0.3 % y/y** (unchanged from November) [17].

TradingEconomics shows the same **0.3 %** annual rate for December 2025 [18].

So:

> Sweden in 2025 has **very low inflation (~0.3 %) – well below the Riksbank’s 2 % target**, after the high‑inflation episode of 2022–23.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

TradingEconomics / SCB:

- **Unemployment rate, November 2025 (NSA):** **8.2 %** [19].
- **Seasonally adjusted unemployment, Nov 2025:** **≈ 9.0 %** [19].

The European Commission expects unemployment to **peak around 9 % in 2025 and then decline** [16].

Hence:

> The labour market is **not in crisis** but **relatively slack by Nordic standards**, with **elevated unemployment around 8–9 %** and particularly high rates among youth and some migrant groups.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Side‑by‑side overview (≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate value |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$58,100** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **\$74,900** |
| **Median gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 34,400 SEK/month ≈ \$3,500 → \$42k/year** |
| **Average gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 52–54k SEK/month ≈ \$5,300–5,500 → \$64–66k/year** |
| **Median household disposable income** | **≈ 400k SEK/year ≈ \$39k PPP** |
| **Median per‑person disposable income** | **≈ 180–200k SEK/year ≈ \$17–18k PPP** |
| **Gini (income)** | **≈ 0.29** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (60 % median)** | **14.8 %** |
| **Relative poverty (50 % median, OECD)** | **8.4 %** |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 8–9 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 0.3 %** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 1.5–2.0 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs wages and incomes**
   - **GDP per person (\$58k nominal, \$74.9k PPP)** exceeds the **median individual wage (~\$42k)** and dwarfs the **median per‑person disposable income (~\$17–18k PPP)**.
   - This is typical of a **high‑tax, high‑public‑spending economy**:
     - A large share of GDP flows into **taxes, social contributions and public services**,
     - Part goes to **corporate profits and investment**,
     - The remaining portion is **cash income for households**.

2. **Mean vs median wages**
   - The **mean gross wage (~52–54k SEK)** is ≈ **50 % higher** than the **median (34.4k SEK)**.
   - A relatively small number of **high earners** (finance, tech, senior management) **pull the average up**; the typical worker sits closer to the median.

3. **From wages to household standards**
   - A **single median earner** (≈ \$42k gross) may net around **\$30k/year** after tax and employer/employee social contributions, which, shared with others, yields **\$12–15k/person** in a 2–3 person household—comfortably above national poverty measures.
   - **Dual‑earner households** with both partners near or above median typically reach **upper‑middle living standards**, while **single‑earner and part‑time/low‑wage households** can easily drop below the **60 % of median** poverty line.

4. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - With a **Gini ≈ 0.29**, Sweden is **very equal by income**—yet **14–15 %** of the population is still considered **at risk of poverty** on a relative basis.
   - This stems from:
     - A cluster of **low‑income and single‑person households**,
     - Higher vulnerability among **immigrants and long‑term unemployed**,
     - High **housing costs** in major cities, which strain low cash incomes even in a generous welfare state.

5. **Macro context: growth, inflation, labour market**
   - **Real GDP growth (~1.5–2.0 %)** with **near‑zero inflation (~0.3 %)** implies **real incomes are edging up**.
   - However, **unemployment around 8–9 %** and weak demand in some sectors keep **household consumption subdued**, as noted by the National Institute of Economic Research and bank research.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Sweden 2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross monthly income (SEK)

Use these brackets to position a worker in Sweden’s income distribution:

- **< 25,000 SEK/month** (≲ **\$2,550**)
  – Often **entry‑level, part‑time or low‑skill**; difficult to live alone in major cities without sharing costs.

- **25,000–35,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$2,550–3,570**)
  – **Lower‑middle**; around the **median**; common for many public‑sector and service roles.

- **35,000–50,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$3,570–5,100**)
  – **Solid middle**; many experienced professionals, technicians, teachers.

- **50,000–70,000 SEK/month** (≈ **\$5,100–7,140**)
  – **Upper‑middle**; IT, engineering, finance, senior healthcare, mid‑level management.

- **> 70,000 SEK/month** (≳ **\$7,140**)
  – **High income**; senior managers, top specialists, high‑level consulting/finance roles.

### 5.2 Household net disposable income (per month, 2–3 people)

Based on ≈400k SEK/year median household disposable income:

- **< 25,000 SEK/month net**
  – Often **low‑income or near‑poverty**, especially in metropolitan regions with high housing costs.

- **25,000–40,000 SEK/month net**
  – **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but limited savings; vulnerable to job or health shocks.

- **40,000–65,000 SEK/month net**
  – **Broad middle class**; can handle mortgage/rent, transport, childcare and some saving.

- **> 65,000 SEK/month net**
  – **Comfortable/affluent**; strong savings/investment potential, even in Stockholm’s pricier districts.

## 6. Short “Sweden 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Sweden** is a **rich, relatively egalitarian welfare state** with **nominal GDP per person around \$58,100** and **PPP GDP per head about \$74,900**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **34,400–37,100 SEK/month** (≈ **\$3,500–3,800**, ~**\$42–45k/year**), whereas the **average wage** is considerably higher at **≈ 52–54k SEK/month** (≈ **\$64–66k/year**) due to a substantial high‑pay tail. There is **no statutory minimum wage**; instead, sectoral collective agreements—covering about **90 % of workers**—set lower bounds in the **25–30k SEK/month** range. After taxes and transfers, the **median household** lives on about **400k SEK/year** (≈ **\$39k PPP**), and the **median person** on **≈ 180–200k SEK/year**, while Sweden’s **income inequality is low (Gini ≈ 0.29)** and **relative poverty affects around 8–15 %** of people depending on the threshold used. With **real GDP growing 1.5–2 %**, **inflation near 0.3 %**, and **unemployment at 8–9 %**, Sweden couples **very high per‑capita output and strong social protection** with **some pockets of joblessness and relative poverty**, especially among single‑person, migrant and low‑skill households. Overall, headline GDP and wage levels are high, but everyday living standards are shaped by household composition, housing costs, and whether one is closer to the **median** or the **upper‑income** segments of this still‑unequal but comparatively compressed wage distribution.
