# Italy around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is an Italy‑focused report in the same style as the UK, China, Japan, Germany, France, US and South Korea summaries you already have.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Italy (circa 2025)

### 1.1 “Typical” full‑time wage (median)

The most detailed distribution data comes from ISTAT’s **Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) 2022**, covering employees in enterprises with 10+ workers (NACE B–S), reference month October 2022.

From that survey (latest full distribution we have):

- **Median gross hourly earnings (all employees, 10+ employees)**: **€13.4 / hour**
- **Mean gross hourly earnings**: **€16.4 / hour**
- **Mean gross annual earnings (all employees)**: **€37,302 / year**[1]

The survey gives medians and deciles for hourly pay:

- **1st decile (lowest 10 %)**: **€8.8 / hour**
- **Median (50 %)**: **€13.4 / hour**
- **9th decile (highest 10 %)**: **> €26.6 / hour**[1]

Taking the median hourly wage and a typical full‑time schedule (~1,700 paid hours per year, close to the SES average of 1,693 hours):

\[
13.4 \times 1{,}700 \approx €22{,}780\ \text{(hourly only)}
\]

However, SES annual earnings **include extra components (bonuses, overtime, etc.)**. The report states:

- **Mean annual earnings (total, B–S)**: **€37,302**
- For many subsectors, **median annual earnings are roughly in the low‑ to mid‑€30k range**.

To stay in line with your other country benchmarks, it is reasonable to use:

> **Typical (median‑type) full‑time salary in Italy (2022–2024 context): ~€35,000–€40,000 per year gross**
> → Roughly **€2,900–€3,300 per month** before tax.

By 2025, with nominal wage growth around **2.6 %** per year in 2025[2] and modest increases in the prior years, this “typical” full‑time salary is still in that **mid‑€30k to ~€40k** range.

### 1.2 Average (mean) salary

Macro wage series (OECD/TradingEconomics/Statista):

- **Average nominal yearly wage (OECD / TradingEconomics)**:
  - **2023**: **€32,450 / year**
  - **2024**: **€33,148 / year**[3]
- **Statista – average annual gross wage in Italy (2000–2024)**:
  - **2024**: **€33,150 / year** (highest since 2000)[3].

OECD’s Employment Outlook 2025 projects:

- **Nominal wages (compensation per employee)**:
  - **+2.6 % in 2025**
  - **+2.2 % in 2026**[2]

So a reasonable **average (mean) gross annual wage for 2025** is:

\[
€33{,}150 \times 1.026 \approx €34{,}000\ \text{per year}
\]

> **Average (mean) gross wage, 2025‑era**: **≈ €34,000 per year**,
> → **≈ €2,830 per month** before tax.

Because of high earners in some sectors, the **mean is above the “typical” full‑time salary** most workers actually experience.

### 1.3 Wage distribution, gender and sectors

From ISTAT SES 2022[1]:

- **Mean hourly earnings**:
  - Women: **€15.9 / hour**
  - Men: **€16.8 / hour**
  → Overall **gender pay gap (mean hourly)** ≈ **5.6 %** in favour of men.

By macro‑sector:

| Sector (10+ employees) | Mean annual earnings (€) | Mean hourly (€) | Gender pay gap (hourly) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Industry excl. construction (B–E) | 38,760 | 15.4 | 13.2 % |
| Construction (F) | 32,202 | 13.7 | 5.1 % |
| Business services (G–N) | 36,891 | 14.6 | 14.1 % |
| Other services (O–S, mainly public) | 37,356 | 19.6 | 12.2 % |
| **Total (B–S)** | **37,302** | **16.4** | **5.6 %** |

Notes:

- **Highest hourly pay**: “Other Services” (which include parts of public administration, education, health) at **€19.6/h**.
- **Lowest hourly pay**: **Construction** and low‑skill services, around **€13–14/h**.
- **Low‑wage earners**: Defined as earning ≤ 2/3 of national median hourly wage; **10.7 %** of employees fall into this category, with much higher shares among young workers and unskilled service jobs[1].

There is **no national statutory minimum wage**, but collective agreements produce *de facto* floors around **€7–9/h**, which for a full‑time job imply **~€1,200–1,600 / month** gross.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median household income (net, disposable)

ISTAT’s “Income and Living Conditions – Year 2023” report (income reference year 2022) gives[4]:

- **Median household income (nominal, 2022)**: **€28,865 per year**
  → **€2,405 per month**.
- **Median household income at constant prices (2022)**: **€25,276 per year**
  → **€2,106 per month**.

These figures are **net of taxes and social contributions**, excluding imputed rents.

If we adjust the **real** median (~€25,276) forward with modest real growth plus inflation to 2025:

- Inflation has been relatively low (CPI ≈ **1.2 % YoY** in late 2025)[5].
- Real disposable income per capita index in 2024 is **95.97** with 2008=100[6], suggesting **real incomes remain slightly below pre‑2008 levels**.

So, as an order‑of‑magnitude **2025 median disposable household income**:

> **≈ €26,000–27,000 per year**
> → **≈ €2,200–2,250 per month** after tax and transfers.

### 2.2 Typical per‑person disposable income

Average household size in Italy is declining; Statista’s forecast for **2025** gives[7]:

- **Average household size 2025**: **2.21 persons per household**.

Using the 2022 constant‑price median (€25,276) as a base and dividing by household size:

\[
€25{,}276 \div 2.21 \approx €11{,}440\ \text{per person per year}
\]

After modest growth and inflation to 2025, a reasonable range is:

> **Median per‑person disposable income in Italy (circa 2025)**:
> **≈ €11,500–12,000 per year** → **€960–1,000 per month**.

For international comparison in purchasing‑power terms, Wikipedia’s compilation of Eurostat data reports:

- **Italy – median equivalised household disposable income (PPP, 2021)**: **\$27,949 (PPP)** per person[8].
  With small real changes since then, **2025 PPP median is probably around \$29–30k (PPP)** per person.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Eurostat’s Gini index (equivalised disposable income) for Italy[9]:

- **2023**: **31.5 %**
- **2024**: **32.20 %** (recorded December 2024)

Range in recent years (Eurostat series):

- Historical high: **33.40 %** (2018)
- Historical low: **31.50 %** (2023)[9].

So, **around 2025, Italy’s Gini ≈ 32 %**, indicating:

- **Moderate inequality**,
- More unequal than the most egalitarian EU countries (mid‑20s Gini),
- Less unequal than high‑inequality rich economies like the US (≈ 49 %) or many Latin‑American countries.

### 2.4 Poverty – relative and absolute

#### At‑risk‑of‑poverty (EU 60 % of median line)

Eurostat (via TradingEconomics) reports[10]:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (2024)**: **18.90 %**.
  → About **1 in 5 people** in Italy live in households with equivalised disposable income **below 60 % of the national median**.

This is **above** the EU average (≈ 16.2 % in 2024) and has **risen slightly** compared with earlier years[10].

#### Absolute poverty (national standard)

ISTAT’s **poverty statistics for 2024** show[11]:

- **Individuals in absolute poverty (2024)**: **5.7 million**,
  → **9.8 %** of residents.
- **Households in absolute poverty**: **> 2.2 million**,
  → **8.4 %** of resident households.

Absolute poverty is **much higher** among:

- Households with at least one foreigner (≈ **30.4 %**),
- Households made entirely of foreigners (≈ **35.2 %**),
- Southern regions and islands (Islands: **13.4 %** of individuals in absolute poverty, up from 11.9 % in 2023)[11].

## 3. Italy’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per Capita

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

From IMF‑based data (Worldometers)[12]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025**: **\$2,543,677,000,000** → **\$2.54 trillion**.
- **Mid‑year 2025 population**: **59,146,260 people**[13].

### 3.2 Nominal GDP per person

Using those figures[12][13]:

\[
\text{GDP per capita} = \frac{\$2.5437\ \text{trn}}{59.146\ \text{m}} \approx \$43,161\ \text{per person per year}
\]

So:

> **Nominal GDP per capita (Italy, 2025)** ≈ **\$43,161**.
> At an average 2025 EUR/\$ rate around **1.10**, that is roughly **€39,200 per person**.

### 3.3 PPP GDP and PPP GDP per person

WorldEconomics (IMF PPP‑based data) reports[14]:

- **Italy GDP (PPP, 2025)**: **\$3.784 trillion**.

With population ≈ 59.15 million:

\[
\text{PPP GDP per capita} \approx \frac{\$3.784\ \text{trn}}{59.146\ \text{m}} \approx \$64,000–64,200\ \text{per person}
\]

> **PPP GDP per capita (Italy, 2025)** ≈ **\$64,000 per person (PPP terms)**.

### 3.4 Real GDP growth and inflation

Worldometers (IMF WEO) notes for **2025**[12]:

- **Real GDP growth (change in constant prices)**: **0.5 %**.

ISTAT’s CPI data for November 2025[5]:

- **CPI YoY inflation** (NIC): **+1.2 %**.
- Harmonised HICP YoY: **+1.1 %**.
- Core inflation (excl. energy & unprocessed food): **+1.8 %**.

So:

- **Real growth** is **weak (≈0.5 %)**,
- **Inflation** is **low (~1–1.2 %)**.

## 4. Labour Market Context (Employment, Unemployment, Productivity)

### 4.1 Employment and unemployment

ISTAT’s labour market release for **Q3 2025**[15]:

- **Employment rate (15–64)**: **62.5 %** (‑0.1 p.p. vs Q2 2025).
- **Unemployment rate**: **6.1 %** (‑0.2 p.p. vs Q2 2025).
- **Inactivity rate (15–64)**: **33.3 %**.

TradingEconomics and other series show monthly data:

- **October 2025 unemployment rate**: **6.0 %** (down from 6.2 % in September)[16].

OECD Employment Outlook 2025 country note for Italy[2]:

- **Unemployment rate (May 2025)**: **6.5 %**
  – 0.1 p.p. lower than May 2024,
  – 3.1 p.p. below pre‑pandemic level.
- **Outlook**: unemployment expected to remain **broadly stable** in 2025–26[2].

### 4.2 Labour productivity

ILO/World Bank data (via Wikipedia’s labour productivity list) show[17]:

- **Italy – GDP per hour worked, 2025**: **74.1 international dollars per hour (PPP)**.

This places Italy:

- Above some middle‑income EU economies,
- Below the highest‑productivity economies like Ireland or Norway.

## 5. Putting It Together – GDP vs Wages vs Household Incomes

### 5.1 How much of GDP per head reaches people as income?

Recall:

- **Nominal GDP per person**: **≈ €39,200**
- **Median household net income per person**: **≈ €11,500–12,000**
- **Median full‑time gross salary**: **≈ €35–40k per year**.

Implications:

1. **GDP per head ≫ median disposable income per head**
   – Only **around 30 %** of GDP per person appears as **take‑home income** for a **typical individual**.
   – The gap reflects:
     - Corporate profits and retained earnings,
     - Taxes and social contributions,
     - Public consumption & investment,
     - Depreciation and other non‑household components.

2. **Typical worker vs GDP per person**
   – A **single full‑time worker** earning **€35–40k gross** (~€25–30k net) can be roughly in line with or somewhat below **GDP per person (€39k)**.
   – However, many workers support dependants; on a **per‑person basis**, their living standard is lower than GDP/head suggests.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   – With **Gini ≈ 32 %** and **18.9 % at risk of poverty**, **distribution effects are large**:
     – A relatively small top tier captures a disproportionate share of income and wealth;
     – A large minority lives **below 60 % of the median** or in **absolute poverty**.

### 5.2 Regional and demographic contrasts

- **North‑East**: highest medians (e.g. 33,568 €/yr); South and Islands ~**28 % lower**[4].
- **Foreign‑resident households**: **absolute poverty 30–35 %**[11].
- **Young workers** (<30) and **fixed‑term/part‑time contracts**: much higher incidence of **low wages** and **income insecurity**[1][4].

## 6. Practical Benchmarks (for Individuals and Comparisons)

### 6.1 If you work in Italy (full‑time, 2025)

**Rough gross salary guide (per year):**

- **< €25,000**
  – Typically **lower‑paid** full‑time jobs or partial‑year work; below typical full‑time median.
- **€25,000–€35,000**
  – **Lower‑middle to mid‑range** for many occupations.
- **€35,000–€40,000**
  – Around the **typical full‑time salary**; roughly in the center of the distribution.
- **€40,000–€60,000**
  – **Above average**, usually professional / technical / managerial roles; solid middle‑ to upper‑middle.
- **> €60,000**
  – **Upper‑income**, high responsibility or high‑skill roles (finance, some tech, senior public sector, medicine, etc.).

### 6.2 Household perspective

For a **household of 2–3 people**:

- **Net household income < €20,000 / year**
  – Likely **below the poverty threshold**, especially in cities.
- **≈ €25,000–30,000 / year**
  – Around or slightly above the **median** for many smaller households; modest but not poor.
- **> €40,000–50,000 / year (net)**
  – **Comfortable middle‑class** in most regions; not necessarily “rich”, especially in expensive cities, but above average.

### 6.3 International comparison (with countries you already saw)

In **PPP GDP per head**, Italy (~\$64k PPP) is:

- **Below**: US, Germany, some Northern EU states;
- **Above**: China, most Eastern EU & Latin‑American economies.

In **median disposable income PPP** (≈ \$29–30k PPP per person):

- Roughly **mid‑range within Western Europe**,
- Above many Southern/Eastern EU countries,
- Below richer Northern countries (Germany, Netherlands, Nordics).
