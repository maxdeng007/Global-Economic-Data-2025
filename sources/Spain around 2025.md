# Spain around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is a Spain‑focused report in the same style as your UK, China, Japan, Germany, France, USA, South Korea and Italy “turns”.

## 1. Salary Levels in Spain (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Median (typical) wage – full‑time workers

The best “typical worker” figure comes from Spain’s **wage‑decile statistics (EPA)**:

- **Median gross monthly wage (main job, 2024)**: **€2,001.4** [1]
  → **≈ €24,000 per year** before tax.
  Assuming ~40 hours/week:

  - **Median gross hourly wage** ≈ €2,001.4 ÷ (4.33 weeks × 40 h) ≈ **€11.5–12 / hour**.

2025 EPA wage‑decile data are not yet fully published; using the reported **5% average wage increase from 2023 to 2024** as a guide, a **reasonable 2025 median estimate** is:

- **Estimated median gross monthly wage 2025**: **≈ €2,100**
  → **≈ €25,200 per year** (still around **€12–13 / hour** for a standard full‑time schedule).

Interpretation:

- A **full‑time worker on ~€24–25k gross per year** is roughly at the **middle** of the Spanish wage distribution.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage

Several sources give compatible orders of magnitude for **average wages** (all employees):

- **INE wage‑decile (EPA) 2024**:
  - **Average gross monthly wage (main job)**: **€2,385.6**
    → **≈ €28,600 per year** [1].

- **TradingEconomics – Average nominal monthly wages (2025)**:
  - **Q2 2025**: **€2,416.5 / month**
  - **Q3 2025**: **€2,268.0 / month**
  - **Q4 2025 (forecast)**: **~€2,500.9 / month** [18].

- Various 2025 salary guides:
  - **Playroll**: average gross annual salary ≈ **€28,050** (≈ €2,338/month) [16].
  - **HousingAnywhere**: average ≈ **€27,000 / year** (≈ €2,250/month) [15].
  - **Hightekers**: average ≈ **€31,600 / year** (≈ €2,633/month) [8].

Taken together (and trusting INE and the EPA most), a workable 2024–25 range is:

- **Average gross monthly wage**: **≈ €2,300–2,400**
- **Average gross annual wage**: **≈ €27,600–28,800**.

Because of high earners at the top, the **mean is clearly higher than the median** (~€2,000/month).

### 1.3 Minimum wage (SMI)

The **Minimum Interprofessional Wage (SMI)** for **2025** is officially:

- **€1,184 / month** if paid in **14 instalments**
  → **€16,576 / year** [4][5].
- Equivalent if paid in 12 instalments:
  - **€1,381 / month** [4].

So a full‑time worker on the minimum wage earns around:

- **≈ 55–60 % of the median wage**,
- **≈ 60–70 % of the average wage**.

This defines a **large low‑wage segment** in the labour market.

### 1.4 Wage distribution snapshot

From **EPA wage‑decile press notes**:

- **2024** wage ranges [1]:
  - **Bottom 20.4 % of full‑time workers**: < **€1,582.2 / month** (gross).
  - **Middle 40 % (deciles 4–7)**: **€1,582.2 – 2,659.8 / month**.
  - **Top 34.8 %**: ≥ **€2,659.8 / month**.

Roughly:

- **< €1,600 / month** → lower‑income bracket.
- **€1,600–2,650 / month** → broad middle.
- **> €2,650 / month** → upper third of the wage distribution.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median disposable income per person and household

For **living standards** we move from wages to **equivalised disposable income** (after taxes and transfers, adjusted for household size).

Eurostat and secondary summaries indicate:

- **Spain’s median equivalised disposable income (latest years)**:
  - Just **below the EU average** of **€21,582** in 2024; a good working figure is **≈ €21,000 / year per person** in Spain [22].

For a **typical household**:

- Average household size 2025: **≈ 2.45 persons** [28].
- Then a middle‑of‑the‑distribution household has:

  \[
  21{,}000 \times 2.45 \approx 51{,}500\ \text{€ per year}
  \]

So:

> **Median‑type Spanish household disposable income ≈ €51–52k per year** (all members included, after tax and social transfers).

### 2.2 Average disposable income (mean)

From OECD/World Bank data compiled on Wikipedia [26]:

- **Disposable income per capita (PPP, 2024)**: **\$43,596** per person.

This is an **average, PPP‑adjusted** figure:

- In nominal euro terms (using a PPP factor ≈ 0.75 €/Intl \$), this is ≈ **€32,700 per person**.

Because the **mean is above the median (~€21k)**, the **distribution is skewed upward** by higher‑income households.

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Eurostat (via TradingEconomics):

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income, 2024**: **31.20 %** [3].

Interpretation:

- Spain’s income distribution is **moderately unequal**:
  - **More unequal** than the most egalitarian EU countries (Nordics: mid‑20s).
  - Roughly similar to or slightly above **France / Germany** (~30 %).
  - Considerably **more equal** than the **US** (~48–49 %).

### 2.4 Poverty – AROPE and risk‑of‑poverty

The **Living Conditions Survey (ECV 2024)** gives a comprehensive poverty picture [2]:

- **AROPE (At Risk of Poverty or Social Exclusion), 2024**: **25.8 %** of population.
  - **Risk of poverty (income < 60 % of national median)**: **19.7 %**.
  - **Severe material deprivation**: **8.3 %**.
  - **Very low work intensity**: **8.0 %**.
  - **All three conditions simultaneously**: **1.3 %** of population.

By age:

- **<16 years**: **34.7 %** AROPE.
- **16–64 years**: **25.8 %**.
- **65+**: **19.5 %**.

Regional pattern (examples) [2]:

- **Highest AROPE rates**:
  - Andalucía: **35.6 %**
  - Castilla–La Mancha: **34.2 %**
  - Extremadura & Murcia: **32.4 %** each.
- **Lowest AROPE rates**:
  - País Vasco: **14.8 %**
  - Baleares: **16.2 %**
  - Navarra: **18.3 %**.

So, while Spain is a **high‑income country**, **about 1 in 4 residents** is officially at risk of poverty or social exclusion, with particularly **high rates among children** and in the **south**.

## 3. Spain’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

IMF‑based data compiled by Worldometers:

- **Nominal GDP (2025)**: **\$1,891,371,000,000** ≈ **\$1.89 trillion** [6].
- **Population (mid‑2025)**: **47,889,958** (≈ **47.9 million**) [9].

### 3.2 GDP per capita – nominal

Using those figures [6][9]:

\[
\text{GDP per capita} \approx \frac{\$1{.}891\text{T}}{47{.}89\text{M}} \approx \$38{,}040\ \text{per person per year}
\]

At a rough 2025 EUR/\$ of ~0.89:

- **Nominal GDP per capita**: **≈ €33,800 / person per year**.

### 3.3 GDP per capita – PPP

From IMF and PPP‑focused compilations [21][10]:

- **PPP GDP per capita (Spain, ~2025)**: **≈ \$58,000 per person** (international \$).

Complementary World Bank / TradingEconomics data:

- **PPP GDP per capita 2024 (World Bank)**: **\$48,373** [20].
- Forecast for 2026 (TradingEconomics model): **\$49,437** [20].

The IMF value is somewhat higher due to methodological differences but is consistent with **Spain at ~90–95 % of the EU’s PPP GDP per head**, in line with Eurostat statements [19].

### 3.4 Real growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth (2025)**: **2.9 %** (IMF WEO) [12].
- **Inflation, CPI (December 2025, flash)**: **2.9 % year‑on‑year** [11].

So 2025 is characterised by:

- **Solid real expansion (~2.9 %)**,
- **Inflation** around the ECB target,
- Making Spain one of the **faster‑growing advanced economies in Europe** in that year.

### 3.5 Unemployment

From TradingEconomics (EPA data):

- **Unemployment rate 2025**:
  - Q1: **11.36 %**
  - Q2: **10.29 %**
  - Q3: **10.45 %** [13].

This implies an **annual unemployment rate around 10.5 %**, still **much higher** than the EU average but lower than Spain’s own post‑crisis peaks.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Side‑by‑side comparison

| Indicator (around 2025)                          | Approx. value              |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita**                       | **\$38,040** (~€33,800)    |
| **PPP GDP per capita**                           | **~\$58,000**              |
| **Median gross wage (full‑time)**                | **~€25,200 / year**        |
| **Average gross wage (full‑time)**               | **~€28,000 / year**        |
| **Median equivalised disposable income (person)**| **~€21,000 / year**        |
| **Average disposable income per capita (PPP)**   | **\$43,596 / year**        |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)**         | **31.2 %**                 |
| **AROPE (poverty or social exclusion)**          | **25.8 % of population**   |
| **Unemployment rate**                            | **~10.5 %**                |

Observations:

- **GDP per person** (~€33.8k nominal, ~\$58k PPP) is **well above**:
  - what a **typical full‑time worker earns** (~€25k gross), and
  - what the **median person has to live on after tax** (~€21k).

- Only **part of GDP** flows to household disposable income:
  - Some remains as **corporate profit** or **retained earnings**.
  - A substantial share goes to **taxes and social contributions**, financing **public consumption and investment**.
  - There is also **depreciation** of capital and other non‑household uses.

- The **mean vs. median gap** (e.g., \$43.6k average disposable vs. ≈ €21k median equivalised) signals **significant inequality**, consistent with Gini 31.2 % and AROPE 25.8 %.

### 4.2 Who is “typical” in Spain?

- A **typical full‑time employee**:
  - ~**€2,000 / month** gross (2024), rising to ~**€2,100 / month** in 2025.
  - Net take‑home will be significantly lower after social security and tax (often around **€1,500–1,600 / month** for that gross bracket).

- A **typical person in a middle‑income household**:
  - Has **≈ €21k/year** in **equivalised disposable income**, i.e. about **€1,750 / month** per “standard adult”.

- A **typical household** (~2.45 members):
  - Lives on **≈ €51–52k net / year**, or **~€4,200–4,300 per month** in disposable income.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks for Spain (2025)

### 5.1 For an individual worker

Use **gross annual salary** as your main reference:

- **< €20,000 / year**
  → Typically **low‑paid**, may be part‑time, temporary, or in low‑wage sectors; below the national full‑time median.

- **€20,000–€25,000 / year**
  → **Just below or around** the full‑time **median**. Represents many junior and low‑skill roles.

- **€25,000–€35,000 / year**
  → **Middle to upper‑middle** of the wage distribution. Standard for skilled office workers, many professionals, some experienced technicians.

- **> €35,000 / year**
  → **Upper‑income bracket** in Spain. Frequently associated with senior professionals, managers, or high‑skill/tech roles (especially outside Madrid/Barcelona, this is clearly above average).

- **> €50,000 / year**
  → Roughly **top 10 %** territory according to distribution comments and percentile analyses.

### 5.2 For a household

Think in **net disposable income**:

- **Household net income < €20,000 / year**
  → Typically **below the risk‑of‑poverty line**, especially for households with children.

- **€20,000–€35,000 / year**
  → **Low to lower‑middle**; above poverty for small households without children, but tight for larger families.

- **≈ €50,000 / year (net)**
  → Around the **median standard of living** for a ~2.5‑person household.

- **€60,000–80,000 / year (net)**
  → **Comfortable middle to upper‑middle class**, especially outside Madrid/Barcelona or high‑tourism coastal zones.
