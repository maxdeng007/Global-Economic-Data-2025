# Ireland around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Ireland “turn”**, in the same style as your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Ireland (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) earnings

CSO **Earnings and Labour Costs** releases for 2025 give strong “typical” benchmarks for full‑time employees:

- **Average weekly earnings, Q3 2025:**  
  - **€1,003.81/week**, up 4.9 % from €956.56 in Q3 2024 \[1\].  
  - Monthly equivalent (×4.33): **≈ €4,345/month**.

- **Average hourly earnings, 2025:**  
  - Range across quarters **≈ €30.48–31.72/hour** (Q1–Q3 2025) \[1\]\[2\].  

With **~32.5–33 paid hours/week** (CSO), this implies:

- **Typical gross monthly income:**
  - Hourly (€30.5) × hours (≈33) × 4.33 ≈ **€4,350–4,600/month**.

Ireland’s wage distribution is not extremely skewed, so these “average” figures are a good **median‑type proxy**:

> **Working benchmark for a typical full‑time worker (2025):**  
> **≈ €4,400–4,700/month gross**, i.e. **≈ €53,000–56,000/year**.

Using a rough 2025 FX of **€1 ≈ \$1.1–1.13**:

- **Typical full‑time worker:** **≈ \$59,000–63,000/year gross**.

Assuming ≈165 working hours per month:

- **Typical gross hourly wage:**  
  4,500 ÷ 165 ≈ **€27/hour** → **≈ \$29–30/hour**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) earnings

From the same CSO releases and 2025 “year in numbers” summary:

- **Average weekly earnings, Q1 2025:** **€1,026.20/week** (+5.6 % YoY) \[2\].  
- **Average weekly earnings, Q2 2025:** **€1,015.43/week** (+5.3 % YoY) \[3\].  
- **Average weekly earnings, Q3 2025:** **€1,003.81/week** (+4.9 % YoY) \[1\].

Taking **≈ €1,015/week** as a central 2025 mean:

- Monthly ≈ **€4,400/month gross**.  

The mean and the “typical” level from §1.1 are very similar, so **mean ≈ median** for practical purposes.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Ireland has a statutory national minimum wage:

- **From 1 January 2025:**  
  - **€13.50/hour** for employees aged 20 and over \[4\]\[5\].  

Using a **full‑time month ≈ 165 hours**:

- **Minimum monthly wage (20+, 2025):**  
  13.50 × 165 ≈ **€2,228/month**.  

In annual and USD terms:

- **≈ €26,700/year** → **≈ \$29,000–30,000/year**.

Relative to typical wages:

- **Minimum vs typical worker (~€4.5k/month):** **≈ 50 %**.  

So, a full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns about **half** what a typical full‑time worker earns.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Ireland’s **national gender pay gap** shows up mainly through organisational reports (under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act) and consolidated commentary:

- Many 2025 employer reports and national syntheses show:
  - **Mean gender pay gap:** **≈ 11–13 %** (women earn ~87–89 % of men’s average hourly pay).  
  - **Median gender pay gap:** **≈ 7–10 %** (women earn ~90–93 % of men’s median pay) \[6\]\[7\].

This aligns with broader EU data, where Ireland’s gender pay gap is:

> **Moderate by EU standards** – **smaller than the EU average**, but women still earn roughly **10 % less than men overall**, and **~7–8 % less** for similar jobs.

### 1.5 Sector and regional contrasts

From salary guides and sector snapshots (Morgan McKinley salary guide, RemotePeople, etc.) \[8\]:

- **High‑pay sectors:**
  - **IT & Tech:** many mid‑ to senior roles **€5,000–8,000/month+**.  
  - **Pharma & Med‑tech:** professionals and managers often **€5,500–9,000/month**.  
  - **Finance / Asset management / Big 4:** experienced staff **€5,000–8,000/month**, senior roles more.

- **Mid‑range sectors:**
  - **Professional services, engineering, public sector professionals (teachers, mid‑level health workers):** generally **€3,500–5,500/month**.

- **Lower‑pay sectors:**
  - **Hospitality, retail, basic services:** many roles **€2,000–3,000/month**, i.e. **near the minimum wage**.

**Regional pattern:**

- **Dublin & Greater Dublin Area:** salaries often **~10 % above** national averages, but rents are much higher.  
- **Other cities (Cork, Galway, Limerick):** slightly below Dublin pay but with lower housing costs.  
- **Rural areas:** wages somewhat lower, especially in services and agriculture.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household and per‑person disposable income

From CSO **SILC 2024** (income reference year 2023) and associated briefings \[9\]\[10\]:

- **Median equivalised disposable income (per person):**  
  - **€29,996/year** → **≈ €2,500/month**.  

- **Median nominal household disposable income (all households):**  
  - **€58,922/year** → **≈ €4,910/month** \[9\].  

- **Median household disposable income for owner‑occupiers:**  
  - **€66,805/year** → **≈ €5,567/month** \[9\].

Equivalised income already adjusts for household size, but for a concrete picture:

- A typical 2–2.2‑person household at the **median per‑person level (€30k)** gives a **household income ≈ €60–66k/year**, which matches the household medians above.

In USD terms (2025 FX ~1.1–1.13):

- **Median equivalised disposable income:** **≈ \$33,000–34,000/year per person**.  
- **Median household:** **≈ \$65,000–75,000/year**, depending on household type.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

CSO SILC equality of income tables (2024) and Eurostat show:

- **Gini coefficient (equivalised disposable income, 2024):**  
  - **26.9 %** → **0.269** on a 0–1 scale \[11\].  

TradingEconomics’ Eurostat extract is similar: **≈ 26.4 %** for 2024 \[12\].

This means:

> Ireland has **low income inequality** by international standards, **more equal** than the EU average (≈0.29–0.30), and close to the Nordic countries.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and incidence

The **at‑risk‑of‑poverty line** is **60 % of median equivalised disposable income**:

- Median ≈ **€29,996/year** → **60 % ≈ €17,998/year**.  
- That is **≈ €1,500/month** for a **single adult** \[10\].  

Converted to weekly for some policy documents:

- **≈ €366.30/week**; anyone below this is **at risk of poverty** \[13\].

Core poverty indicators:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (AROP, after social transfers, 2023–24):**  
  - Public briefings indicate a rate of **about 10.6–11.7 %** of the population, i.e. **roughly 1 in 9 people** \[10\]\[13\].

- **Enforced deprivation rate (SILC 2025):**  
  - **14.8 %** in 2025, down from **15.7 % in 2024** and **17.3 % in 2023** \[14\].  

- **Consistent poverty** (both below 60 % line and deprived):  
  - Rose from **3.6 % in 2023 to 5 % in 2025**, according to NGO briefings \[10\].

Interpretation:

- **Absolute, deep poverty is rare**, but:
  - **≈ 10–12 %** are **income‑poor by EU standards**,  
  - **≈ 15 %** face significant **material deprivation**, and  
  - A smaller but worrying share experience **consistent poverty** despite overall high national income.

## 3. Ireland’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Output, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per capita

IMF, World Bank and Worldometers (IMF‑based) give for **2025** \[15\]\[16\]\[17\]:

- **Total nominal GDP:**  
  - **≈ \$708–725 billion**.

- **Population:**  
  - **≈ 5.3 million**.

Thus:

- **Official nominal GDP per capita, 2025:**  
  - **≈ \$129,000–137,000/person** (Worldometers quotes **\$129,132**, IMF DataMapper around **\$135k**).

Important caveat:

- This is **inflated by multinational profit‑shifting** and does not reflect typical resident incomes. Adjusted metrics (like modified GNI*, not detailed here) are **substantially lower**.

### 3.2 PPP GDP per capita

PPP data (TradingEconomics, WorldEconomics, IMF) place Ireland at:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025:**  
  - Around **\$115,000–133,000/person PPP** \[16\]\[17\].  

So, even after adjustment for prices, Ireland sits in the **very top tier globally**, alongside or above many rich EU and Nordic economies.

### 3.3 Real GDP growth

IMF and European Commission forecasts for 2025 \[15\]\[18\]:

- **Real GDP growth 2025:**  
  - **≈ 2.2–2.3 %** for the domestic economy,  
  - Headline “GDP” can spike much more due to multinationals; EC even notes **double‑digit growth (≈10.7 %)** in some 2025 forecasts driven by export surges \[18\].

For resident living‑standard analysis, **2–3 % real domestic growth** is a reasonable anchor.

### 3.4 Inflation

CSO CPI releases and CEIC data \[19\]\[20\]:

- **Annual CPI, June 2025:** **+1.8 % YoY** \[19\].  
- **Annual CPI, August 2025:** **+2.0 % YoY** \[20\].  
- **Annual CPI, November 2025:** **+3.2 % YoY** (highest since Feb 2024) \[19\]\[20\].  

Core inflation (ex‑food and energy):

- **≈ 2.1 % YoY in August 2025** \[21\].  
- Central Bank projections: **core ~2.4 % in 2025**, drifting toward **1.9 %** later \[21\].

So:

> Inflation in 2025 is **moderate**, roughly **2–3 %**, slightly above the ECB target but far below 2022–23 peaks.

### 3.5 Labour market – unemployment

CSO Monthly Unemployment and TradingEconomics \[22\]:

- **Seasonally‑adjusted unemployment rate, July 2025:** **4.9 %** \[22\].  
- **Nov–Dec 2025:** **≈ 5.0 %** (5 % in December, 4.9 % in November).

Commentary from CSO and the government:

> **Unemployment around 5 %** – **low by EU standards**, consistent with a **tight labour market**, despite some sectoral soft spots and higher youth unemployment.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Key indicators side‑by‑side (Ireland ≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate value |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita (official)** | **\$129k–137k/year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **≈ \$115k–130k/year** |
| **Typical full‑time worker gross wage** | **≈ €4,400–4,700/month ≈ €53k–56k/year** |
| **Average weekly earnings (Q3 2025)** | **€1,003.81/week (~€4,345/month)** |
| **National minimum wage (2025)** | **€13.50/hour (~€2,230/month)** |
| **Median equivalised disposable income (per person)** | **€29,996/year (~€2,500/month)** |
| **Median household disposable income (all households)** | **€58,922/year (~€4,910/month)** |
| **Median household disposable income (owner‑occupiers)** | **€66,805/year (~€5,567/month)** |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)** | **0.269 (26.9 %)** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate** | **≈ 10.6–11.7 %** |
| **Enforced deprivation rate (2025)** | **14.8 %** |
| **Unemployment (late 2025)** | **≈ 5.0 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, late 2025)** | **≈ 3.2 % YoY** |
| **Real GDP growth (underlying)** | **≈ 2–3 %** |

### 4.2 Relationships and interpretation

1. **GDP per head vs typical incomes**

- Official **GDP per head (~\$130k)** is **far above**:
  - A **typical worker’s gross pay (~\$60k/year)**, and  
  - The **median per‑person disposable income (~€30k ≈ \$33k)**.
- This gap reflects:
  - **Massive multinational profits and booking practices**,  
  - **Corporate taxes and public spending**,  
  - GDP being averaged across **children, retirees, non‑earners**, not just full‑time workers.

For understanding **ordinary living standards**, **equivalised disposable income and wages** are much better indicators than headline GDP/head.

2. **Wages vs poverty threshold**

- **Typical gross monthly wage (~€4.5k)** translates to **roughly €3.2–3.5k net** for a single worker.  
- For a 2‑person household, this is **€1,600–1,750 per person**, only moderately above the **poverty line (€1,500/month)**.  
- **Dual‑earner households** (two workers near typical wages) more easily reach **€5–7k/month net**, firmly in the middle‑class range.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**

- **Gini ≈ 0.27** indicates **low income inequality**, and social transfers cut pre‑transfer poverty roughly **from mid‑teens to ≈10–11 %**.  
- Still:
  - **≈ 1 in 9 people** live below **60 % of median income**,  
  - **Enforced deprivation** affects **~15 %**,   
  - Certain groups (lone parents, renters, some migrant communities) are at much higher risk.

4. **Inflation and real wages**

- Nominal wages rose **~5–6 % in 2025**, while inflation was **~2–3 %**, so **average real wages improved slightly**.  
- But:
  - Gains are **stronger in high‑productivity sectors** (IT, pharma, finance),  
  - **Rent and housing costs**, especially in Dublin, erode the effective purchasing power of many households close to median incomes.

5. **Labour market vs insecurity**

- With **unemployment near 5 %**, Ireland has **near‑full employment** in macro terms.  
- However, **precarious contracts, high housing costs, and the working poor** (≈140,000 workers at risk of poverty \[13\]) show that **having a job doesn’t always guarantee comfort**.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Ireland 2025)

### 5.1 Individuals – gross monthly income (approximate brackets)

- **\< €2,000/month**  
  - Often **part‑time, entry‑level or low‑wage**; difficult to live independently in cities; likely **near or below poverty** if supporting dependants.

- **€2,000–€3,000/month**  
  - **Lower‑middle**; typical for many retail, hospitality and junior administrative roles.

- **€3,000–€4,500/month**  
  - Around/below the **typical full‑time range**; junior to mid‑level professionals; can be comfortable outside the highest‑cost areas.

- **€4,500–€6,500/month**  
  - **Core middle‑class range**; experienced professionals, many public‑sector roles, mid‑level managers.

- **> €6,500/month**  
  - **Upper‑middle to high income**; senior professionals, managers, tech/finance specialists.

### 5.2 Households – net monthly income (2–3‑person household)

Using **€1,500/month per adult** as the poverty line and **median household ≈ €5–5.5k/month**:

- **\< €3,000/month**  
  - Typically **at or below poverty** for a 2‑adult or small family household; heavy reliance on transfers and careful budgeting.

- **€3,000–€4,500/month**  
  - **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but **little buffer**, significant pressure from rent, childcare and energy costs.

- **€4,500–€7,000/month**  
  - **Broad middle class**; aligns with many dual‑earner households around/beyond the median; able to manage housing, transport, and some savings.

- **> €7,000/month**  
  - **Comfortable/affluent**, especially outside central Dublin; strong capacity to save, invest, and weather shocks.

## 6. Short “Ireland 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Ireland** is a **very high‑income, relatively equal economy** whose headline numbers are heavily distorted by multinational profits. Official **nominal GDP per person (~\$130k)** and **PPP GDP per head (~\$115k+)** place it at the top of global rankings, but a **typical full‑time worker** earns about **€4,400–4,700/month gross** (≈ **€53–56k/year**), while the **national minimum wage** is **€13.50/hour** (≈ **€2,230/month**), roughly **half** that typical wage. After taxes and transfers, the **median adult‑equivalent disposable income** is **€29,996/year** (~€2,500/month), and a typical household lives on **about €4,900–5,600/month**, depending on tenure.  

Income inequality is **low (Gini ≈ 0.27)**, and social transfers reduce the **at‑risk‑of‑poverty rate to around 10–12 %**, though **enforced deprivation still affects about 15 %** and consistent poverty has ticked up for some groups. With **unemployment at about 5 %**, **real GDP growing 2–3 %**, and **inflation around 2–3 %**, Ireland offers a combination of **strong macro fundamentals and modest real wage gains**, but **high housing and living costs**, especially in Dublin, mean that the daily experience of many lower‑ and lower‑middle‑income households remains considerably tighter than the country’s spectacular GDP figures suggest.
