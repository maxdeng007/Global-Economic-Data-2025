# Australia around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the Australia “turn”, in the same style as your UK / China / Japan / EU / US / Canada profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Australia (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median) worker

From ABS **Employee Earnings, August 2025**:

- **Median weekly earnings (main job)**:
  - **\$1,425 per week** in August 2025 → **≈ \$74,100 per year** (before tax) \[1\].
- **Median hourly earnings (main job)**:
  - **\$42.90 per hour** in August 2025 \[1\].
  - At a standard **38‑hour week**:
    \[
    42.90 \times 38 \times 52 \approx \$84{,}800 \text{ per year}
    \]

Because the weekly median includes many part‑timers, the **hourly median** is the better guide to a **typical full‑time rate**:

> **Reasonable benchmark for a typical full‑time employee, 2025:**
> **≈ \$85,000 per year**, or **≈ \$42.90/hour** (pre‑tax).

**By sex (August 2025)** \[1\]:

- **Men:** median **\$44.60/hour**
- **Women:** median **\$41.70/hour**

So women’s median hourly earnings are about:

\[
41.70 / 44.60 \approx 0.94
\]

→ **~6–7 % lower than men’s**.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages

ABS **Average Weekly Earnings, May 2025** \[5\]:

- **Average weekly earnings (all employees)**: **\$2,010.00**
  → **≈ \$104,500 per year**.

Adult full‑time average ordinary‑time earnings (from ABS/WGEA summary) \[7\]:

- **Men:** **\$2,106.40/week** → **≈ \$109,500/year**
- **Women:** **\$1,864.10/week** → **≈ \$96,900/year**

So:

> **Average full‑time worker:** **≈ \$100,000–105,000 per year** (before tax).
> **Average employee (incl. part‑time):** **≈ \$104,500/year**.

This is well above the **median full‑time‑type ≈ \$85k**, showing the impact of high earners in the distribution.

### 1.3 National minimum wage

Australia has a single **National Minimum Wage** (NMW) for adult award‑free employees:

- **From 1 July 2025**:
  - **\$24.95 per hour**
  - **\$948.00 per week** for a 38‑hour week \[3\].

Annualised:

\[
948 \times 52 \approx \$49{,}300 \text{ per year}
\]

For casuals, there is a **25 % loading**:

- **Casual NMW 2025:** **\$31.19/hour** \[7\].

So a full‑time minimum‑wage worker earns about **60 % of a typical full‑time worker’s median pay (~\$85k)**.

### 1.4 Quick wage benchmarks (gross, per year)

- **Minimum wage, full‑time:** **~\$49k**
- **Typical full‑time worker (median‑type):** **~\$85k**
- **Average full‑time:** **~\$100–105k**
- **Men vs women:** women’s hourly pay is **~6–7 % lower** than men’s.

If you want to self‑place:

- **\< \$60k:** low‑end or part‑time for a full‑timer.
- **\$60–90k:** broad middle.
- **\$90–120k:** upper‑middle.
- **\> \$120k:** top slice of earners (especially outside the very top‑pay sectors).

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median disposable income per person and per household

ABS **Household income and wealth** (equivalised, after tax and transfers, adjusted for household size):

- **2022–23 median equivalised disposable household income:**
  - **\$1,192 per week** (June 2023 prices) \[6\].
  - Annualised: **≈ \$62,000 per year per “equivalised adult”**.

AIHW’s **Australia’s welfare 2025** shows this continues to rise:

- **2024 median real equivalised household disposable income:** **\$1,464 per week** (2024 dollars) \[2\].

That is a real series; to keep things simple and consistent with nominal pay, use the ABS 2022‑23 figure as the main **nominal benchmark** and think of 2025 as **a bit higher**, ~\$63–65k per year equivalised.

**Average household size** is about **2.6 persons** \[19\]. So:

- **Median equivalised disposable income** ≈ **\$62–65k/year per equivalised adult**.
- For a **“typical” 2.6‑person household**, that implies **total disposable income around \$90–100k/year**, depending on composition.

A commonly quoted rule‑of‑thumb from Local Insight 2025:

- **Median *gross* household income 2025 ≈ \$95,000 per year** \[12\].

If we allow for tax and transfers, a **plausible ballpark** is:

> **Median household disposable income (cash to live on): ≈ \$75–85k per year**.
> **Median per‑person disposable share:** **≈ \$28–32k per year**.

This aligns with the equivalised ABS figure and typical tax burdens.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

OECD and Australian summary data report:

- **Gini coefficient (after tax & transfers): ~0.32–0.33** around 2023–25 \[9\][11\].

That means:

- **More equal** than the US (≈0.48) and UK (~0.33).
- **Less equal** than the most egalitarian Nordic systems (~0.25–0.27).
- Close to **Germany/France** (~0.29–0.30).

In words: **moderate inequality** for a rich country.

### 2.3 Poverty – relative (50 % of median income)

ACOSS’s **Poverty in Australia 2025** using the **50 % of median household disposable income** (after housing costs) threshold finds \[13\]:

- **Poverty line 2025 (after housing costs):**
  - **Single adult:** **\$584/week** → **≈ \$30,400/year**.
  - **Couple with 2 children:** **\$1,226/week** → **≈ \$63,800/year**.

- **People in poverty (2025):**
  - **≈ 3.7 million people**, or **14.2 % of the population** \[13\].
    → About **1 in 7 Australians**.

Child poverty:

- Separate analysis puts **children in poverty** (50 % line) at **roughly 30 %**, and **about 40 %** for children in **single‑parent households** \[14\].

So even with high GDP/head:

> A sizeable minority, especially **children and single‑parent families**, lives well below median living standards.

## 3. Australia’s GDP and GDP per Person

### 3.1 GDP size and population

IMF‑based numbers (via Worldometer / WorldEconomics):

- **Nominal GDP 2025:** ≈ **US \$1.85 trillion**; with an average **USD/AUD ≈ 0.72**, that’s about **A\$2.57 trillion** \[15\][16\].
- **Population mid‑2025:** **≈ 26.97 million** \[16\].

### 3.2 GDP per capita – nominal and PPP

**Nominal (market prices):**

\[
\text{GDP per head} \approx \frac{2.57 \text{ trillion AUD}}{26.97 \text{ million}} \approx \textbf{A\$95,000 per person per year}
\]

IMF/Worldometers also give a direct **GDP per capita in USD**:

- **2025 nominal GDP per capita:** **≈ US \$65,946** \[20\] → also **~A\$92–96k**, depending on the FX rate.

**PPP (purchasing power parity):**

- IMF PPP data show **Australia’s PPP GDP/head ≈ US \$73,000–74,000** in 2025 \[17\].
  → In AUD, that is roughly **A\$100,000–105,000 per person** at 0.72 USD/AUD.

So:

> **Output per person:** **≈ A\$95k nominal**, **≈ A\$100k+ on a PPP basis**.

### 3.3 Real growth and inflation

ABS national accounts (September 2025) \[18\]:

- **Quarter‑on‑quarter GDP growth (Q3 2025):** **+0.4 %**.
- **Year‑on‑year real growth:** **+2.1 %** since September 2024.

Inflation (CPI):

- **Annual CPI to November 2025:** **+3.4 %** \[19\].

So:

- **Real GDP growth** ≈ **2.1 %**.
- **Inflation** ≈ **3.4 %**, trending down but still above the RBA’s 2–3 % target band.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment

ABS Labour Force data and commentary:

- **Trend unemployment rate, October–November 2025:** **4.3–4.4 %** \[21\].
- **ABS media release (Dec 2025):** “Unemployment rate remains at **4.3 %**” \[21\].

Thus, Australia has:

> **Low unemployment (~4.3 %)**, close to estimates of “full employment”.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

Putting the main numbers in one table:

| Indicator (≈2025) | Approximate value |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **GDP per person (nominal)** | **≈ A\$95k / year** |
| **GDP per person (PPP)** | **≈ US \$73k ≈ A\$100k+** |
| **Median full‑time wage (implied from hourly)** | **≈ A\$85k / year** |
| **Average full‑time wage** | **≈ A\$100–105k / year** |
| **Minimum‑wage full‑time** | **≈ A\$49k / year** |
| **Median equivalised disposable income** | **≈ A\$62–65k / year** |
| **Median household gross income** | **≈ A\$95k / year** |
| **Relative poverty rate (50 % line)** | **≈ 14.2 %** |
| **Gini (after tax & transfers)** | **≈ 0.32–0.33** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 4.3 %** |

**Key relationships:**

1. **GDP per head vs personal incomes**
   - GDP/head (~A\$95k) is **higher than the typical full‑time wage (~\$85k)** and **much higher than the typical per‑person disposable income (~\$25–30k)**.
   - Only **a fraction** of GDP flows into **household disposable income**; the rest is:
     - Corporate profits and retained earnings,
     - Depreciation,
     - Government consumption and investment,
     - Taxes and net transfers abroad.

2. **Wages vs disposable income**
   - A **median full‑time worker on ~\$85k** will net around **\$60–65k after income tax** (before super/compulsory pension).
   - That **net** is similar in size to the **median equivalised disposable income**.
   - When that income is spread across **2–3 people**, **per‑person living standards** are closer to **\$25–30k per person per year**, consistent with the ABS equivalised figure.

3. **Inequality and poverty overlay**
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.32** and **14.2 % below the 50 %‑median line**, **distribution matters**:
     - A small top segment receives very high incomes and assets.
     - A large low‑income group (especially children, single parents, and some renters) lives well below the median, despite national prosperity.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks

### 5.1 For an individual worker (gross, per year)

Use this (very rough) guide:

- **\< \$50k** – Close to the **minimum‑wage band** or substantial part‑time. Below typical full‑time mid‑point.
- **\$50–70k** – **Lower‑middle** full‑time; common in entry‑level professional, admin and lower‑skill roles.
- **\$70–90k** – Around the **“typical full‑time”** range (median‑type ~\$85k).
- **\$90–120k** – **Upper‑middle**, especially outside high‑pay sectors; many mid‑senior professionals.
- **\> \$120k** – **Top deciles**; high‑level professionals, managers, and specialist roles.

### 5.2 For a household (after‑tax income, per year)

Given median household incomes and equivalised data:

- **\< \$40k** – Below poverty for most households (except some singles).
- **\$40–60k** – **Low‑income**; often qualifies for significant welfare and concessions; constrained lifestyle particularly in major cities.
- **\$60–90k** – **Around the median** in disposable terms; adequate but not affluent, especially for families with children.
- **\$90–130k** – **Comfortably middle‑class** in most of Australia, though housing costs in Sydney/Melbourne can still bite.
- **\> \$130k** – **Upper‑income** household, especially if outside the inner capitals.

## 6. One‑paragraph “Australia 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Australia** is a **very high‑income country** with **nominal GDP of about US \$1.85 trillion (≈ A\$2.57 trillion)** and **GDP per person around A\$95k nominal (≈ US \$66k), or roughly US \$73k on a PPP basis**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **\$85k per year** at a median **\$42.90/hour**, while the **average full‑timer** earns roughly **\$100–105k**, and the **national minimum wage** sets a floor of **\$24.95/hour (~\$49k/year)**. After taxes and transfers, a **median household** has **around \$75–85k** per year to live on (≈ \$62–65k equivalised), giving a **per‑person disposable income in the mid‑\$20k–low‑\$30k range**. Income inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.32–0.33)**, but **about 14 % of Australians—roughly 1 in 7—live below a poverty line set at 50 % of median disposable income**, with child poverty notably higher. Real GDP growth is **about 2.1 %**, inflation is easing toward **3.4 %**, and unemployment is **low (~4.3 %)**, so Australia combines **strong per‑capita output and a tight labour market** with **non‑trivial income inequality and a sizable low‑income population**.
