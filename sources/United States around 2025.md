# United States around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is a **U.S.‑focused report** in the same style as the UK, China, Japan, Germany and France summaries you already have.

Where figures are for 2024 or quarterly 2025, I explain how they map to a **2025‑era “typical” picture**.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in the U.S. (2025)

### 1.1 “Typical” full‑time salary (median)

The best national measure of what a **typical full‑time worker** earns is the **BLS “Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers”**.

- **Median usual weekly earnings of full‑time workers – Q3 2025:**
  **\$1,214 per week** (all wage and salary workers, 16+), not seasonally adjusted [1][2].

Turn that into annual and hourly figures:

- **Implied median annual earnings (full‑time):**
  \[
  \$1{,}214 \times 52 \approx \$63{,}128 \text{ per year (before tax)}
  \]
- **Implied median hourly earnings** (≈40 hours/week):
  \[
  \$1{,}214 \div 40 \approx \$30.35 \text{ per hour}
  \]

So a good single number for the **“mid‑point” U.S. full‑time salary in 2025** is:

> **≈ \$63,000 per year before tax, or ≈ \$30/hour**

**Gender gap (Q3 2025)** [2]:

- **Men:** median \$1,333/week → **≈ \$69,300/year**
- **Women:** median \$1,076/week → **≈ \$56,000/year**
- Women’s median earnings are **about 80–81%** of men’s.

---

### 1.2 Average (mean) earnings

Means are higher than medians because of high earners at the top.

From BLS and related series for late 2025:

- **Average weekly earnings – all employees, total private (October–November 2025):**
  – Around **\$1,264 per week** [3][5]
  – **Implied mean annual earnings:**
    \[
    \$1{,}264 \times 52 \approx \$65{,}700 \text{ per year}
    \]

- **Average hourly earnings – all private employees (late 2025):**
  – **\$36.67 per hour** (nominal) [8].
  – At 40 hours/week → **\$1,467/week** (pure hourly × hours); the official average‑weekly‑earnings series (≈\$1,264) includes actual paid hours and composition effects.

So:

> **Typical (median) full‑time worker:** ≈ **\$63k/year**
> **Average worker (all employees, including high earners):** ≈ **\$66k/year**

---

### 1.3 Sector differences (broad picture, 2024–25)

Using standard BLS wage distributions:

- **High‑pay sectors (full‑time, average annual):**
  - Information, professional & technical services, finance – often **\$75k–\$80k+ per year**
- **Lower‑pay sectors:**
  - Accommodation & food services, retail, some personal services – often **\$30k–\$40k per year**

Public‑sector vs private:

- On average, **federal and many state/local government jobs** pay **comparable or slightly higher base wages** than similar private jobs and often have **richer benefits**.
- But the **highest salaries** are concentrated in the **private sector** (finance, tech, executive roles), which pull up the national mean.

---

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median household income (what a “typical” household gets)

The **U.S. Census Bureau** measures **household money income** (pre‑tax cash income from all sources).

- **Median household income – 2024:** **\$83,730** [6].
  – Not statistically different from 2023 (\$82,690).
  – This is the income of the “middle” household; half of households earn less, half more.

With the economy growing modestly and inflation around 2–3%, this is a good **anchor for 2025‑era household income** as well.

### 2.2 Income per person inside the typical household

- **Average household size** in recent data: **≈ 2.5–2.6 persons** (Census).
  Take **2.6** as a reasonable 2025 figure.

Then, for the **median household**:

\[
\$83{,}730 \div 2.6 \approx \$32{,}200 \text{ per person per year (before tax)}
\]

This is a rough **per‑person share of household pre‑tax income** for the middle household.

### 2.3 Disposable income per person

For actual living standards, we want **disposable personal income per capita** (after personal taxes).

From the **Federal Reserve / BEA series A229RC0**:

- **Disposable personal income per capita – September 2025 (current \$):** **\$67,171** [11].

This is an *average* (mean), not a median. It tells you:

> **On average, each U.S. resident had about \$67,000 per year in after‑tax personal income in 2025.**

Because high earners pull this up, the **median person’s disposable income** is **considerably below \$67k**, probably in the **\$40–50k** range.

### 2.4 Inequality – Gini coefficient

From **Census “Income in the United States: 2024”** and related sources:

- **Income Gini index, 2024 (household money income):** **0.488** [9].

Interpretation:

- A Gini of **0.488** is **high by rich‑country standards**:
  - Much **higher inequality** than Germany or France (~0.29–0.30).
  - Higher than the UK (~0.33).
  - Roughly in line with other **high‑inequality rich economies**.

Other sources (World Bank/Our World in Data) give similar orders of magnitude (mid‑0.4s for post‑tax, post‑transfer income; higher if you look at market income before taxes and transfers).

### 2.5 Poverty

Census **“Poverty in the United States: 2024”** report:

- **Official poverty rate (OPM), 2024:** **10.6%** [10].
  – **35.9 million** people in poverty.
- Supplemental analyses (CBPP, HHS, CRS) broadly agree on this ballpark.

Additional details from compiled poverty data [10]:

- **Deep poverty (below 50% of the poverty line):** about **5%** of the population.
- **Below 2 × the poverty line:** about **26%** – more than a quarter of Americans live with income less than double the official threshold.

This means that:

> Even though the **U.S. is very rich on average**, about **1 in 10 people** is officially poor, and **about 1 in 4** lives on less than **twice** the poverty threshold.

---

## 3. U.S. GDP (Size of the Economy) and GDP per Person

### 3.1 Nominal GDP – 2025

IMF World Economic Outlook and derived compilations (Worldometers, Statista):

- **U.S. nominal GDP 2025:** **\$30.62 trillion** (current prices) [12].

This is the **largest economy in the world** in nominal terms.

### 3.2 Population in 2025

Census “Happy New Year 2025!” and other population projections:

- **Estimated population on 1 January 2025:** **341,145,670** [13].
- Other mid‑year estimates are similar (342–343 million).

### 3.3 Nominal GDP per person

Use \$30.62 trillion and 341.1 million people:

\[
\text{GDP per person} \approx \frac{\$30{,}620{,}000{,}000{,}000}{341{,}145{,}670} \approx \$90{,}000 \text{ per person per year}
\]

So:

> **Nominal GDP per capita in the U.S. around 2025 is about \$90,000 per person per year.**

Because the dollar is the reference currency in many PPP comparisons, **PPP GDP per capita is similar in level**, though PPP‑based estimates from the World Bank/IMF usually put the U.S. a little lower relative to very high‑cost peers.

### 3.4 Real GDP growth

IMF projections and BEA releases:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025 (annual):** about **2.0%** [14].
- BEA’s Q3 2025 release shows **annualised quarterly growth of 4.3%** (July–September), consistent with **~2% for the full year** once you average quarters [15].

Given population growth around ~0.5–0.8%:

> **Real GDP per person** is growing roughly **1–1.5% per year**.

### 3.5 Inflation (CPI)

BLS CPI:

- **Year‑on‑year CPI increase by late 2025:** approximately **2.6–2.7%** [16][17][18].

So 2025 looks like:

- **Moderate inflation**, near the Fed’s 2% target, after the higher inflation of 2021–2023.
- **Nominal growth** (~4–5%) is split between **real growth (~2%)** and **inflation (~2–3%)**.

## 4. How GDP, Wages, and Incomes Fit Together

We can now directly compare **what the economy produces per person** with **what a typical worker or household actually receives**.

### 4.1 Headline comparison

| Metric (approx, 2024–25) | Amount |
|--------------------------|--------|
| **GDP per person (nominal)** | **\$90,000 / year** |
| **Disposable income per person – average (mean)** | **\$67,000 / year** [11] |
| **Median full‑time worker salary (pre‑tax)** | **\$63,000 / year** [1][2] |
| **Median household income (pre‑tax)** | **\$83,700 / year** [6] |
| **Income Gini (household)** | **≈ 0.49** [9] |
| **Poverty rate (official)** | **10.6%** [10] |

Observations:

1. **GDP per person (\$90k)** is **much higher** than:
   - What the **typical worker** earns (\$63k), or
   - What **average disposable income per person** is (\$67k).

2. This gap exists because part of GDP is:
   - **Retained corporate profit**,
   - **Depreciation of capital**,
   - **Government consumption and investment**,
   - And other non‑household components.

3. After taxes and transfers, **only around two‑thirds of GDP per head** becomes **disposable income per person on average**, and **considerably less** for the *median* person.

### 4.2 Inequality’s role

- The **mean disposable income per capita (\$67k)** is **substantially above** what many people actually experience because:
  - The **top 10%** take a very large share of income and wealth.
  - The **bottom half** of households capture a relatively small share of the total.

- The **Gini of ≈0.49** indicates:
  - Income distribution in the U.S. is **more unequal** than in most Western European countries.
  - Even with high aggregate GDP per head, a sizable group lives **near or below the poverty line**.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (for Individuals and Households)

### 5.1 For a U.S. worker around 2025

You can roughly place yourself using these **full‑time gross annual salary** brackets:

- **< \$40,000**
  – Likely in the **lower third** of full‑time earners (many service, retail, hospitality jobs, or partial‑year work).

- **\$40,000–\$60,000**
  – **Below to around the median** (\$63k).
  – Many administrative, early‑career professional, skilled trade roles.

- **\$60,000–\$90,000**
  – **Middle to upper‑middle** for full‑time workers.
  – Common for mid‑career professionals, many tech roles outside the highest‑paying hubs, some experienced trades.

- **>\$100,000**
  – Typically in the **top 15–20%** of earners nationwide.
  – High‑skill professions, management, tech, finance, medicine, etc., especially in major metros.

### 5.2 For a U.S. household

Using **pre‑tax money income**:

- **Household income < \$50,000**
  – Below the **national median** and close to or below local poverty thresholds in many high‑cost regions (especially for families with children).

- **\$50,000–\$90,000**
  – Around the **middle** for many household types; exact position depends on household size and region.
  – For a **single adult**, this can mean a comfortable standard of living in many areas; for a **family of four in a major city**, it’s closer to lower‑middle.

- **\$90,000–\$150,000**
  – Generally **middle to upper‑middle class**, especially outside the highest‑cost coastal metros.
  – For households with 2 earners, this is common among dual‑professional couples.

- **>\$150,000**
  – **Upper‑income** nationally; well into the top quintile, especially for larger households.

## 6. Short “USA 2025” Summary (Aligned with Your Other Country Profiles)

- **Typical full‑time worker (median):**
  – **\$1,214 per week**, ≈ **\$63k per year** before tax (≈ \$30/hour) [1][2].

- **Average earnings (all employees):**
  – **Average weekly earnings:** ≈ **\$1,264** → **\$65.7k/year** [3][5].
  – **Average hourly earnings:** ≈ **\$36.7/hour** [8].

- **Households and disposable income:**
  – **Median household income:** ≈ **\$83.7k/year** [6].
  – **Average disposable personal income per person:** ≈ **\$67k/year** [11].

- **Inequality and poverty:**
  – **Gini coefficient:** ≈ **0.488** (high inequality) [9].
  – **Official poverty rate:** **10.6%** (≈36 million people) [10].
  – About **26%** live on less than **2× the poverty line** [10].

- **Macroeconomy:**
  – **Nominal GDP 2025:** ≈ **\$30.62 trillion** [12].
  – **GDP per person:** ≈ **\$90k/year**.
  – **Real GDP growth:** ≈ **2.0%** (annual) [14][15].
  – **Inflation (CPI):** ≈ **2.6–2.7%** year‑on‑year in late 2025 [16][17][18].

In other words, the **United States in 2025** is a **very high‑income economy (around \$90k of GDP per person), with a typical full‑time salary around \$63k, a median household around \$84k, and substantial income inequality** that leaves a **notable minority (1 in 10) in poverty** despite the high national averages.
