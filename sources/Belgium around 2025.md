# Belgium around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

This is the Belgium “turn”, aligned with the other country profiles you provided.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Belgium (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage

- **Median gross monthly wage (all employees, 2025):**
  - **€3,728 / month** (Statbel, via Expatica) [1].
  - → **≈ €44,700 / year** before tax.

Assuming a standard **38‑hour week**:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**
  \[
  \approx \frac{€3{,}728}{38 \times 4.33} \approx €22.5–23 / \text{hour}
  \]

This is the **mid‑point** of the wage distribution: **50 % of workers earn less**, 50 % more.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage

- Statbel’s wage structure report shows for **2022** an **average gross monthly salary** of **€4,076** [2].
- Statbel’s **wage index for services** rose **2.9 %** in Q3 2025 versus a year earlier [2].

Using that growth as a guide:

- **Estimated average gross monthly wage 2025:**
  \[
  €4{,}076 \times 1.029 \approx €4{,}190 / \text{month}
  \]
  → **≈ €50,300 / year**.

So, around 2025:

- **Median wage:** ≈ **€3,728 / month**,
- **Average wage:** ≈ **€4,190 / month**.

The **mean is about 12–13 % above the median**, indicating a noticeable but not extreme upper‑tail of high earners.

### 1.3 Minimum wage

Belgium has a **national guaranteed minimum monthly income**:

- **Statutory minimum wage (from 1 Feb 2025):**
  - **€2,111.89 / month** for a full‑time 38‑hour week [3].
  - → **≈ €25,340 / year** gross.
  - **Hourly minimum:** ≈ **€12.82 / hour**.

This means:

- A minimum‑wage worker earns **≈ 57 % of the median wage**,
- **≈ 50 % of the average wage**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

Belgium is an outlier in the EU with a **very small measured gender wage gap**:

- **Harmonised gender pay gap (EU definition, 2023):** **0.7 %** [4].
  - Women’s **average hourly wage** is **99.3 % of men’s**.
  - This is one of the **lowest gaps in the EU**.

(Other, broader concepts of “pay gap” can be higher, but the official hourly‑wage metric is close to parity.)

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences (high‑level)

From Statbel and Belgian wage surveys:

- **Higher‑paying sectors:**
  - Finance, ICT, pharmaceuticals, and some professional services:
    → Many full‑time roles in the **€5,000–7,000 / month** gross range.
- **Mid‑range sectors:**
  - Manufacturing, engineering, construction, healthcare, higher education:
    → Often **€3,500–4,500 / month**.
- **Lower‑pay sectors:**
  - Retail, hospitality, cleaning, some care work:
    → Typically **€2,500–3,500 / month**, clustered around the minimum.

Regionally:

- **Brussels‑Capital Region** generally pays **≈10 % above** the national average;
- Some municipalities (e.g. Attert) have **median annual household incomes > €40,000**, while poorer Brussels municipalities (e.g. Saint‑Josse‑ten‑Noode) have medians just over **€20,000 / year** [18].

---

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Median and average disposable income

For living standards it’s better to look at **net household income after tax and transfers**.

- **Median equivalised household disposable income (PPP, 2021, OECD):**
  - **\$37,110 PPP per year**, or ≈ **€30,700 / year** per “standard adult” [5].
  - This is the **typical post‑tax income level** adjusted for household size.

Given:

- **Average household size (2025):** **2.25 persons** [19],
- Standard equivalence scales, a typical **median household** will have a total disposable income on the order of:

\[
\text{Median household disposable} \approx €30{,}700 \times 1.6 \approx €49{,}000 / \text{year}
\]

So a practical reading is:

> **Median‑type Belgian household disposable income ≈ €49k/year** (≈ €4,100/month).

For averages:

- **Household disposable income per capita (2025 forecast, Statista):**
  - **\$31,390 PPP per person** ≈ **€26,000 / year per person** [6].

Because **mean > median**, Belgium’s income distribution is **mildly skewed**: high earners pull up the average.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient

Eurostat/EEA data show:

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income (Belgium 2024):** **24.7 %** (0–100 scale) [7].
  - On a 0–1 scale, that’s ≈ **0.247**.

Implications:

- **Less unequal** than the EU average (≈ 0.29–0.30).
- In the same very‑egalitarian group as the **Netherlands, Scandinavia, Czechia, Slovenia**.
- Much **more equal** than the **US or UK**.

### 2.3 Poverty – monetary and broader (AROPE)

Belgium uses both **absolute** and **relative (EU)** poverty measures.

**Poverty thresholds (2024 income year)** [8]:

- **Single adult:**
  - Poverty line = **60 % of median equivalised income**
  - → **€1,520 / month** (≈ **€18,240 / year**).
- **Couple with two children:**
  - Poverty line = **€3,191 / month** (≈ **€38,300 / year**).

**Incidence:**

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (AROP, < 60 % median income):**
  - **11.4 %** of population in 2024 [9].
  - Down from 14.8 % in 2019 according to national news coverage [15][16].

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty or social exclusion (AROPE):**
  - **18.3 %** of population in 2024—just over **2.1 million people** [10].
  - This includes:
    - People below the income poverty line,
    - Households with **very low work intensity**,
    - And those facing **severe material deprivation**.

So:

> Roughly **1 in 9 Belgians** is **income‑poor**, and nearly **1 in 5** is **at risk of poverty or social exclusion** on the broader EU indicator.

Children, single‑parent households, and some migrant communities are **over‑represented** in these groups.

## 3. Belgium’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Output, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person

IMF/Worldometer data for 2025 [11][12]:

- **Nominal GDP 2025:** **\$716.98 billion** (≈ **€594 billion**).
- **Population 2025:** **11,825,551**.

Per‑capita:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP per head} \approx \$60{,}700 \ \text{per person} \approx €50{,}300 / \text{year}
\]

### 3.2 GDP per capita – PPP

IMF WEO Data Mapper (PPP per head, 2025):

- **PPP GDP per capita 2025:** **\$75,880** per person [13].
  → ≈ **€62,900** in purchasing‑power terms.

So Belgium sits among the **top 10–15 countries worldwide** on PPP GDP per person, on par with rich EU peers (Netherlands, Germany, Austria).

### 3.3 Real GDP growth and inflation

- **Real GDP growth 2025:** **≈ 1.1 %** (IMF / European Commission / NBB projections) [14].
- **Inflation (CPI, year‑on‑year, Dec 2025):** **2.06 %** [15].
  - Inflation peaked in 2022–23 and has since **normalised towards the ECB target**.

Thus 2025 is characterised by:

- **Moderate real output growth (~1 %)**,
- **Price stability** with CPI ≈ 2 %,
- Leading to **slightly positive real income growth** overall.

### 3.4 Labour market

Statbel and Eurostat/NBB data for 2025 [16][17]:

- **Employment rate (20–64, Q3 2025):** **72.7 %**, one of the higher rates in the EU.
- **Unemployment (ILO definition):**
  - **6.20–6.40 %** in Q3–Q4 2025 (Eurostat/TradingEconomics) [17].
  - Up from about 5.5 % a year earlier, but still **moderate**.

Overall:

> Belgium has a **high employment rate** and a **moderate unemployment rate**, with a labour market that has cooled from post‑pandemic tightness but is not in crisis.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Household Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key numbers side‑by‑side

| Metric (≈2025)                                       | Value (approx.)                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita**                           | **\$60,700** (≈ **€50,300**)      |
| **PPP GDP per capita**                               | **\$75,880** (≈ **€62,900**)      |
| **Median gross wage (individual)**                   | **€3,728 / month** (≈ **€44.7k/y**) |
| **Average gross wage (individual)**                  | **€4,190 / month** (≈ **€50.3k/y**) |
| **Median equivalised disposable income (per adult)** | **≈ €30.7k / year**               |
| **Median household disposable income (all members)** | **≈ €49k / year**                 |
| **Average disposable income per capita (PPP)**       | **≈ €26k / year**                 |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)**             | **24.7 %** (~0.247)               |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty (60 % median)**                 | **11.4 %** of population          |
| **AROPE (poverty or social exclusion)**              | **18.3 %** of population          |
| **Unemployment rate (ILO)**                          | **≈ 6.2–6.4 %**                   |
| **Inflation (CPI)**                                  | **≈ 2.1 % (Dec 2025)**            |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps

1. **GDP per head vs individual wages**
   - GDP/head (~€50k) is **higher than the median salary (~€45k)** but close to the **average wage (~€50k)**.
   - This is expected: GDP includes **profits, taxes, public consumption, depreciation**, and income of people not in the wage statistics.

2. **From wages to disposable income**
   - A median full‑time worker (€44.7k gross) will net around **€28–32k/year** after Belgium’s relatively high taxes and social contributions.
   - In a 2–3 person household, that yields **roughly €1,200–1,400 net per person per month**, in line with median equivalised disposable income estimates (~€30.7k/year per adult).

3. **Low inequality but non‑trivial poverty**
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.25**, Belgium is among the **most equal** OECD countries in **income distribution**.
   - Still, **about 1 in 9 people** live **below the 60 % median income line**, and **nearly 1 in 5** are considered **at risk of poverty or social exclusion**, especially **children, single‑parent families and certain urban/migrant communities**.

4. **Growth vs living standards**
   - Real GDP growth is **modest (~1 %) but positive**, and CPI ≈ 2 %, so **real wages and real household incomes are edging up**, not falling.
   - However, the **wage norm for 2025–2026 was set at 0 %** (no additional margin beyond automatic indexation), so **nominal wage growth is largely just keeping pace with inflation**, not dramatically improving living standards.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Belgium 2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross annual salary

Use these **rough brackets** to place an individual full‑time worker:

- **< €30,000 / year**
  → Typically **low‑paid or part‑time**; near the minimum wage if full‑time.
- **€30,000–€45,000 / year**
  → **Lower‑middle to around the median**; common for many junior clerical, support, and public‑sector roles.
- **€45,000–€60,000 / year**
  → **Middle to upper‑middle**; typical for experienced professionals, skilled technicians, many private‑sector roles.
- **> €60,000 / year**
  → **Upper‑income** in Belgian terms, especially outside Brussels’ top sectors.

### 5.2 Household net disposable income per year

For a **2–3 person household**:

- **< €25,000 / year**
  → Often **below the at‑risk‑of‑poverty line**, particularly with children or in high‑cost cities.
- **€25,000–€40,000 / year**
  → **Lower‑middle**; basic needs met but little buffer.
- **€40,000–€55,000 / year**
  → **Broad middle class**; typical for households near the median.
- **> €55,000 / year**
  → **Comfortable to affluent**, especially if housing costs are moderate.

## 6. Short “Belgium 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Belgium** is a **very high‑income, relatively egalitarian economy** with a **nominal GDP of about \$717 billion** and **GDP per head of roughly \$60,700 (≈ €50,300)**, rising to **\$75,880 (≈ €62,900)** per person in PPP terms. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **€3,728 per month gross** (≈ €44.7k/year), while the **average wage** is roughly **€4,190 per month** (≈ €50.3k/year). The **national minimum wage** of **€2,112/month** gives full‑timers about **€25.3k/year**, roughly **half of the average wage**. After taxes and transfers, the **median adult‑equivalent income is around €30.7k/year**, and a **median household** of ~2.3–2.5 people has about **€49k/year** in disposable income. Income inequality is **low (Gini ≈ 0.25)**, but **around 11–12 %** of Belgians are **income‑poor** and **18 %** are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. With **real GDP growth around 1.1 %**, **inflation near 2 %**, and **unemployment around 6 %**, Belgium combines **high productivity and strong social protection** with **modest growth and a still‑significant low‑income segment**, particularly among children, single parents and in some urban municipalities.
