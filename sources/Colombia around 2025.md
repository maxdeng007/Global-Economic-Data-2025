# Colombia around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Colombia “turn”**, aligned with the structure of your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Colombia (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wages  

A comprehensive 2024 salary report for Colombia finds for **formal full‑time workers**:

- **Median gross monthly salary:** **4,050,000 COP/month**  
  – Using the **2025 average FX** of **1 COP ≈ 0.000247 USD** (≈ **1 USD ≈ 4,040 COP**) [2]:  
  – ≈ **\$1,000/month** → **≈ \$12,000/year**.  

Assuming ≈165 working hours/month:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**  
  \[
  4{,}050{,}000 \div 165 \approx 24{,}550\ \text{COP/hour} \approx \$6.1/hour
  \]

This is a good **“typical worker”** benchmark for Colombia’s formal sector in 2024–2025.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

The same source reports:

- **Average gross monthly salary:** **4,710,000 COP/month** (2024) [1].  
  – At the 2025 FX, this is ≈ **\$1,165/month** → **≈ \$14,000/year**.

So:

- **Median:** 4.05m COP  
- **Mean:** 4.71m COP  

The mean is only **≈ 16 % above the median**, indicating **moderate wage skew** (some high earners, but not as extreme as in very unequal economies).

### 1.3 Minimum wage  

Colombia has a national statutory minimum wage, adjusted annually.

- **Minimum wage 2024:** **1,300,000 COP/month** (≈ **\$320–335**) [1][8].  
- **Minimum wage 2025 (range used in 2024–25 salary analyses):**  
  – **≈ 1,410,000–1,450,000 COP/month** [1].  
  – At ≈4,040 COP/\$, this is **≈ \$350–360/month**.

Relative to the 2024 median wage:

- **Minimum ≈ 1.4–1.45m vs median 4.05m COP → about 35 % of median**.  
- Relative to 2025 effective median (after wage drift), the minimum is roughly **40–45 % of the typical formal wage**.

For many low‑skill service or manual jobs, actual pay is **near this floor**, especially outside Bogotá and major cities.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

Multiple sources give a coherent picture:

- An OECD study using **median monthly wages of full‑time workers** finds women in Colombia earn about **4 % less than men** (OECD‑style gender pay gap = 4 %) [4].  
- A focused study on younger (millennial) workers reports an **adjusted gender wage gap of 9.5 %**, and nearly **14 %** among college‑educated workers [13].  

A reasonable synthesis:

> - **Headline/overall gap**: women earn **≈ 10 % less** than men on average.  
> - **Adjusted gap (similar jobs, full‑time)**: **≈ 4–10 %**, depending on cohort and occupation.

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences (broad)  

Using Colombia‑focused salary guides and typical ranges:

- **Higher‑pay sectors** (mid‑career ranges, gross/month):  
  - **Finance, banking, insurance, multinationals, IT & software, oil & gas:**  
    – Many roles **8–12m COP/month** (≈ **\$2,000–3,000**).  
    – Senior managers and specialized tech roles can exceed **15–20m COP/month** (\$3,700–5,000+).

- **Mid‑range sectors:**  
  - **Engineering, architecture, public administration, secondary education, mid‑level healthcare:**  
    – Often **3–6m COP/month** (≈ **\$750–1,500**).

- **Lower‑pay sectors:**  
  - **Retail, hospitality, basic services, agriculture, low‑skill manufacturing:**  
    – Typically **2–3m COP/month** (≈ **\$500–750**), often just **above the minimum wage**.

**Regional pattern:**

- **Bogotá** and major metros: salaries are **10–15 % above** the national median for comparable roles, but housing and commuting costs are also highest.  
- **Secondary cities** (Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla): close to national averages.  
- **Rural and peripheral regions:** wages in many jobs **10–20 % below** the national median, with more informality.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Per‑capita and household disposable income  

Two complementary views:

1. **Per‑capita disposable income (PPP)**  

   An international comparison of **disposable income per capita (PPP)** shows for **Colombia (2023)**:

   - **Per‑capita disposable income:** **\$16,452 PPP/year** (≈ **\$1,370/month**) [11].  

   This is an **average per person** figure (not household total) in purchasing‑power‑parity terms.

2. **Median household disposable income (PPP)**  

   The OECD’s *Economic Survey of Colombia* (2022) reports:

   - **Median disposable household income:** **\$14,600/year PPP** (2019 basis) [4].  

   That is per **household**, adjusted to PPP using OECD 2017 parities.

Given **average household size ≈ 5 people** (≈53.4m population, 10.7–11m households), we can loosely infer:

- **Median per‑person disposable income:**  
  – \(14,600 / 5 ≈ \$2,900/year\) PPP if interpreted strictly per household;  
  – but per‑capita OECD table gives **\$16,452 PPP/person** [11], so the **per‑capita measure is higher and more reliable** than that older household statistic.

**Working approximation (2023–25):**

> - **Per‑capita disposable income (PPP):** **≈ \$16–17k/year**.  
> - For a **5‑person household**, this implies a “typical” consumption potential on the order of **\$80–85k/year PPP**, though in practice many households are well below that due to inequality.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

Colombia is one of the more unequal countries in the region:

- **Gini coefficient (disposable income, 2023):** **≈ 0.515** [4].  

For comparison:

- OECD average ≈ **0.30**,  
- Typical Western European values: **0.25–0.33**.

So:

> Colombia’s income inequality is **very high by OECD standards**, and still high even in the Latin‑American context, though it has declined from historical peaks.

### 2.3 Poverty – national, extreme and relative  

**National poverty (official line)**  

- A 2025 BBVA analysis based on DANE data reports:  
  – **Monetary poverty rate (national line, 2024): 31.8 % of the population** [12].  
  – Down from **34.6 % in 2023**, meaning about **1.3 million people** exited poverty.

**International poverty lines (World Bank PIP, 2023)**  

- **Poverty at \$3.00/day (2021 PPP):** **7.69 %** of Colombians [3].  
- **Poverty at the national line (again, 2023):** **34.6 %**, consistent with the BBVA 2024 update [3][12].

**Relative poverty (50 % of median income)**  

- CEIC (World Bank source) reports **21.7 %** of Colombians living **below 50 % of the median income** in 2022 [6].  

**Interpretation:**

- About **one in three Colombians** is poor by the **national official line**.  
- Around **one in five** live on **less than half the median income**.  
- **Extreme poverty** (below \$3/day PPP) is **lower but non‑negligible (≈ 8 %)**, concentrated in certain rural regions and vulnerable urban communities.

## 3. Colombia’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Levels, Growth & Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per person  

From IMF‑based Worldometers data:

- **Nominal GDP per capita (2025):** **\$8,249/year** [8].  
- **PPP GDP per capita (2025):** **\$22,396/year** [8].  

With population **≈ 53.4 million**, this implies:

- **Total nominal GDP 2025:** **≈ \$440 billion**.  

Colombia is thus an **upper‑middle‑income economy** with **output per head** clearly above low‑income countries, but still far below advanced OECD levels.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth  

- Worldometers (IMF) and BBVA Research both indicate **real GDP growth 2025** around:  
  – **≈ 2.5 %** [7][8].  

This follows modest growth in 2024 and is driven by:

- Private consumption and investment,  
- Recovery in services and manufacturing,  
- Improved external conditions.

### 3.3 Inflation  

BBVA and DANE data show:

- **Year‑end CPI inflation, 2025:** **5.10 %** [9].  

This is:

- Slightly lower than the previous year (≈5.3 %),  
- Above the central bank’s 3 % target, but a **moderate, disinflating environment** compared with 2021–22.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment  

- **Unemployment rate, November 2025:** **7.0 %** (down from 8.2 % in October) [10].  
- Earlier in 2025, values around **8–9 %** were typical.

Youth unemployment remains considerably higher (≈ **12–15 %**), though exact 2025 figures vary by source.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Fit Together

### 4.1 Key indicators side‑by‑side  

| Indicator (≈2025) | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$8,249/year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **\$22,396/year** |
| **Median gross wage (formal worker)** | **4,050,000 COP/month ≈ \$1,000/month** |
| **Average gross wage (formal worker)** | **4,710,000 COP/month ≈ \$1,165/month** |
| **Statutory minimum wage (2025)** | **≈ 1,410,000–1,450,000 COP/month ≈ \$350–360/month** |
| **Disposable income per capita (PPP)** | **\$16,452/year (2023)** |
| **Median household disposable income (PPP)** | **\$14,600/year (2019 basis)** |
| **Gini coefficient** | **≈ 0.515** |
| **National poverty rate (2024)** | **31.8 %** |
| **Extreme poverty (\$3/day PPP, 2023)** | **7.69 %** |
| **Relative poverty (<50 % median, 2022)** | **21.7 %** |
| **Unemployment (late 2025)** | **≈ 7 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, 2025)** | **≈ 5.1 %** |
| **Real GDP growth (2025)** | **≈ 2.5 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps  

1. **GDP per head vs typical wages**  
   - **PPP GDP/head (\$22.4k)** is notably higher than a **typical worker’s gross pay (~\$12k/year)** and above **per‑capita disposable income (\$16.5k)**.  
   - The difference reflects:
     - **Corporate profits and capital income**,  
     - **Taxes and social contributions**,  
     - The fact that GDP/head includes **children, retirees and non‑workers**, not just employees.

2. **Wages vs household standards of living**  
   - A **single median earner** on **4.05m COP/month** can support a modest lifestyle for themselves but struggles to **sustain a 4–5 person household alone**, especially in large cities.  
   - **Middle‑class stability** typically requires:
     - **Two formal earners** at or above the median, or  
     - Supplementary income (small business, remittances, informal work).

3. **Minimum wage vs poverty**  
   - A full‑time minimum‑wage job (**≈ 1.4–1.45m COP/month**) sits **well below the income needed** for a typical multi‑person household to stay above the **national poverty line**, especially once housing, food and transport are paid.  
   - This is consistent with **national monetary poverty of 31.8 %** and relative poverty around **20–22 %**.

4. **Inequality overlay**  
   - With **Gini ≈ 0.515**, Colombia has a **very unequal income distribution**:  
     - A small upper‑income group captures a **large share of total income**,  
     - Many households cluster around or below the poverty threshold, despite moderate GDP per head.

5. **Macro vs micro**  
   - **Macro indicators** – 2.5 % real growth, 5.1 % inflation, 7 % unemployment – portray a **reasonably stable, growing economy**.  
   - For many households, especially in **informal work, rural areas or low‑skill urban services**, the lived reality remains **precarious**, with incomes only marginally above or below poverty lines and limited buffers against shocks.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Colombia 2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross monthly income (COP)

Use these bands to position a worker in the national distribution:

- **< 2,000,000 COP/month** (≲ **\$500**)  
  – **Low income**; typical of informal jobs, some agriculture and basic services; hard to support a family.

- **2,000,000 – 4,000,000 COP/month** (≈ **\$500–1,000**)  
  – **Lower‑middle**; includes many junior office workers, retail/hospitality jobs, some formal blue‑collar roles; around or below the median in poorer regions.

- **4,000,000 – 6,000,000 COP/month** (≈ **\$1,000–1,500**)  
  – **Core middle**; around/above the national median; typical of mid‑career teachers, nurses, technicians, many public‑sector employees.

- **6,000,000 – 10,000,000 COP/month** (≈ **\$1,500–2,500**)  
  – **Upper‑middle**; many experienced professionals, IT workers, mid‑level managers in urban areas.

- **> 10,000,000 COP/month** (≳ **\$2,500**)  
  – **High income**; senior management, top specialists, successful entrepreneurs, expatriate packages.

### 5.2 Household net monthly income (4–5 person household)

Approximate **net/disposable** ranges:

- **< 5,000,000 COP/month**  
  – Often **below or near poverty** for a 4–5 person household; significant risk of food, housing or education insecurity.

- **5,000,000 – 10,000,000 COP/month**  
  – **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but little financial cushion; vulnerable to job loss or health shocks.

- **10,000,000 – 15,000,000 COP/month**  
  – **Broad middle class**; can manage decent housing, schooling, and some savings in most regions.

- **> 15,000,000 COP/month**  
  – **Upper‑middle/affluent**; strong resilience and discretionary spending, especially outside the most expensive Bogotá neighbourhoods.

## 6. Short “Colombia 2025” Snapshot  

Around **2025**, **Colombia** is an **upper‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP per person about \$8,250** and **PPP GDP per head around \$22,400**. A **typical formal worker** earns about **4.05m COP/month** (≈ **\$1,000**, ≈ **\$12k/year**), while the **average wage** is modestly higher at **4.71m COP/month** (≈ **\$14k/year**). The **statutory minimum wage** (≈ **1.4–1.45m COP/month**) is high by regional standards but still **insufficient for a multi‑person household** without additional earners.  

Per‑capita **disposable income** is around **\$16,452 PPP/year**, yet **inequality is stark (Gini ≈ 0.515)** and **monetary poverty remains high at 31.8 %**, with about **8 % in extreme poverty** and over **20 %** living on **less than half the median income**. Macroeconomic conditions—**2.5 % real GDP growth**, **5.1 % inflation** and **7 % unemployment**—are broadly stable, but a large share of Colombians, especially those in informal or low‑skill employment, still experience **tight budgets and vulnerability**, making the country’s solid aggregate GDP figures feel distant from everyday life for much of the population.
