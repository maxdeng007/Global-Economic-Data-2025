# Israel around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person

Below is an Israel‑focused profile in the same style as your other country “turns”.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Israel (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median) wage – middle of the distribution

National Insurance Institute (NII) wage data for the **first half of 2025**:

- **Median monthly wage (all salaried employees)**:
  **10,586 NIS / month**
  → **≈ 127,000 NIS / year** (before tax) \[1\].

Assuming a standard 38‑hour week:

- **Median hourly wage** ≈
  10,586 ÷ (38 × 4.33) ≈ **64–65 NIS / hour**.

Interpretation:

- This is the **worker in the middle**: half of workers earn less than ~10.6k NIS/month, half earn more.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wage – pulled up by high earners

The same NII report shows:

- **Average monthly wage (all employees, 1H 2025)**:
  **15,098 NIS / month** \[1\].
  → **≈ 181,000 NIS / year** (before tax).

TradingEconomics’ monthly earnings series is consistent, with a nearby value of **14,032–14,109 NIS/month** in mid‑2025 and an October average of **13,620 NIS/month** \[2\][3][7\].

Key point:

- **Median (10,586 NIS) is 43 % below the mean (15,098 NIS)** \[1\].
- This large gap reflects **significant inequality within the wage distribution**.

### 1.3 Minimum wage – legal floor

From 1 April 2025:

- **Minimum monthly wage**: **6,248 NIS / month** (up from 5,880 NIS in 2024) \[4\][5\][6\].
- **Typical hourly minimum**: **≈ 34–35 NIS/hour** (depending on the exact implementation) \[4\][6\].

So a full‑time minimum wage job pays roughly:

> **Minimum ≈ 6,250 NIS vs median ≈ 10,600 NIS vs average ≈ 15,100 NIS per month**.

A minimum‑wage worker earns **about 60 % of the median** and **about 40 % of the mean**.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap

NII’s 2025 report (first half) highlights a very large gender gap:

- **Average men’s wage**: **18,441 NIS / month**.
- **Average women’s wage**: **11,940 NIS / month**.

That is:

- Men earn **≈ 54 % more** than women on average \[1\].

Even allowing for differences in working hours and industry, this indicates a **substantial gender pay gap**.

### 1.5 Sector and regional contrasts (examples)

From the NII wage report \[1\]:

- **High‑pay sectors**:
  - **Utilities (electricity, gas, steam, A/C)**:
    – Average ≈ **31,922 NIS/month**,
    – Median ≈ **28,612 NIS/month**.
  - Information & communications also near the top.

- **Low‑pay sectors**:
  - Accommodation and food services, some support and education roles; many jobs **< 10,000 NIS/month**.

- **City examples (average vs median)**:
  - **Tel Aviv‑Jaffa**:
    – Average ≈ **22,359 NIS/month**,
    – Median ≈ **14,311 NIS/month**.
  - **Jerusalem**:
    – Average ≈ **11,415 NIS/month**,
    – Median ≈ **8,402 NIS/month**.

This shows very large **regional and sectoral disparities**.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

Israel doesn’t publish a single headline “median household income” the way some countries do, but we can triangulate from wages, poverty thresholds and household size.

### 2.1 Poverty thresholds – a concrete benchmark

According to the National Insurance Institute (via 2025 coverage):

- A household is counted as **poor** if income is below:
  - **4,105 NIS per person per month**, or
  - **10,508 NIS/month for a family of four** \[8\].

So:

- A **4‑person family** with <10.5k NIS/month net is officially in poverty.
- This threshold is **below the median wage of a single worker**, showing how a single earner on typical pay supporting several dependents can fall under the line.

### 2.2 Poverty rates (relative poverty)

Latest full figures (for 2023, published Dec‑2024) \[9\]:

- **Overall poverty rate**: **20.7 %** of the population (≈ 1.98 million people).
- **Child poverty**:
  - **27.9 %** of children (≈ 872,400).
- **Elderly poverty**:
  - **12.8 %** of seniors (≈ 158,500).

In the OECD, this puts Israel:

> **Among the very worst for relative poverty**, second only to Costa Rica in some comparisons \[9\].

### 2.3 Inequality – Gini coefficient

The **OECD Economic Survey of Israel 2025** reports \[10\]:

- **Gini coefficient (equivalised disposable income, 2022)**: **0.345**.
- OECD average: **0.316**.

Implications:

- Israel is **more unequal** than the typical OECD country.
- Inequality is **higher than in most Western European countries**, though **lower than in very unequal cases like the US** (≈0.48).

Combined with the **43 % mean‑to‑median wage gap**, this confirms that **a relatively small group at the top pulls averages well above what most people see**.

### 2.4 Household income – rough picture

We have:

- **Average monthly wage (per worker)**: ~**15.1k NIS**.
- **Median wage (per worker)**: ~**10.6k NIS**.
- **Average household size**: ≈ **3.1 persons per household** in 2025 \[11\].

Rough implications:

- A **dual‑earner household** with both partners near the average will have ≈ **30k NIS/month gross** (≈ **362k NIS/year**).
- After income tax and social insurance, such a household might retain **~75–80 %** of gross: roughly **24–26k NIS/month net** (≈ **290–310k NIS/year**).

By contrast:

- A **single‑earner household** living on the **median wage (~10.6k NIS)** and supporting 3–4 people is **not far above the poverty threshold** of 10.5k NIS/month for four.

So the **typical middle‑class household** is more likely to be **dual‑earner**, while **single‑earner families can be quite vulnerable**, especially with children.

## 3. Israel’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and population

Worldometers (IMF‑based) for **2025** \[12\]:

- **Nominal GDP**: **\$610.75 billion**.
- **Population**: **9,517,181 people**.

### 3.2 GDP per person – nominal and PPP

From the same IMF‑based tables and related sources \[12\][13][14\]:

- **Nominal GDP per capita 2025**: **\$60,009**.
- **PPP GDP per capita 2025**: around **\$55,770–\$60,280** (depending on the exact PPP series used).

So in a compact form:

> Israel produces **≈ \$60k of output per person per year in nominal terms**,
> rising to **mid‑\$50k–\$60k per person in PPP terms**.

This level puts Israel:

- Roughly on par with **rich OECD countries** like Austria, Belgium and Germany in nominal terms \[14\].

### 3.3 Real GDP growth

IMF World Economic Outlook data \[15\][16\]:

- One summary lists **Israel’s 2025 real growth at 2.5 %** \[12\].
- IMF’s DataMapper profile also shows **real GDP growth around 3.9 %** (annual) \[15\][16\].

The discrepancy is between different vintages/definitions; practically, you can think of:

> **Real GDP growth 2025 ≈ 2.5–4 %** – i.e., **solid growth**, higher than most advanced economies that year.

### 3.4 Inflation

TradingEconomics and related CPI sources for late 2025 \[17\]:

- **Annual CPI inflation (YoY) – November 2025**: **2.4 %**,
  down from **2.5 %** in October.

The Bank of Israel’s Monetary Policy Report projected:

- **Average inflation 2025** ≈ **2.6 %**, converging toward the **2 % target** \[18\].

So 2025 looks like:

- **Inflation back within or near the target range**, after earlier spikes.
- **Real wage growth is positive**, since average wages grew faster than ≈2.5 % inflation \[1\][3\].

### 3.5 Labour market

TradingEconomics employment data \[2\]:

- **Unemployment rate – November 2025**: **3.10 %**.
- **Employment rate – November 2025**: **≈ 61.1 %** of working‑age population.

This is a **tight labour market** by OECD standards – low official unemployment, though with differences across sectors and regions.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Household Incomes Fit Together

Putting core numbers side by side:

| Metric (≈2025) | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$60,009** \[12\] |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **\$55,770–60,280** \[13\] |
| **Average monthly wage (employee)** | **15,098 NIS** (≈ \$4,400) \[1\] |
| **Median monthly wage (employee)** | **10,586 NIS** (≈ \$3,100) \[1\] |
| **Minimum monthly wage** | **6,248 NIS** (≈ \$1,800) \[4\][6\] |
| **Poverty line – 4‑person household** | **10,508 NIS/month** (≈ \$3,045) \[8\] |
| **Overall poverty rate** | **20.7 %** (2023) \[9\] |
| **Child poverty** | **27.9 %** \[9\] |
| **Gini coefficient** | **0.345** (2022) \[10\] |
| **Unemployment** | **3.1 %** (Nov 2025) \[2\] |
| **Inflation (YoY)** | **2.4 %** (Nov 2025) \[17\] |

### 4.1 Main relationships

1. **GDP per head (\$60k)** vs **typical pay and living standards**
   - GDP per head is **much higher** than the **median individual wage (~\$37k/year)** and **far above the poverty line**.
   - But GDP includes **corporate profits, depreciation, government consumption, and income of non‑residents**. Only a portion becomes **household disposable income**.

2. **Mean vs median wages**
   - With a **43 % gap between average and median wages**, the average worker’s pay is **not representative** of what most people earn.
   - The **median worker** is closer to the **lower middle** of macro aggregates like GDP/head.

3. **Low unemployment but high poverty**
   - Despite **3.1 % unemployment**, **around 1 in 5 Israelis** lives below the relative poverty threshold, and almost **1 in 3 children** is poor.
   - This indicates **a lot of low‑wage, low‑hours or precarious work**, plus high cost of living and large family sizes in some communities.

4. **Inequality overlay**
   - Gini ≈ **0.345** and high mean‑median gap show that **a small upper tier enjoys much higher incomes**, while a large share of households have incomes not far above the poverty line.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (2025)

### 5.1 For an individual worker (gross, per month)

Very roughly:

- **< 6,250 NIS**
  – Below or around **minimum wage**; typically part‑time or informal.
- **6,250–9,000 NIS**
  – **Low‑income** full‑time or near‑full‑time work; many service or entry‑level jobs.
- **9,000–12,000 NIS**
  – Around the **median**; typical for many office, public‑sector and technical roles.
- **12,000–18,000 NIS**
  – **Upper‑middle**; mid‑career professionals, many tech and public‑sector positions.
- **> 18,000 NIS**
  – **High‑income** segment; managers, senior professionals, specialized tech/finance roles.

### 5.2 For a household (net, per month)

Thinking in **total household take‑home**:

- **< 10,500 NIS/month (4‑person household)**
  – **Below poverty line**; qualifies as poor by NII definition.
- **10,500–16,000 NIS/month**
  – **Lower‑middle**; basic needs met but tight, especially with children and in expensive cities.
- **16,000–25,000 NIS/month**
  – Broad **middle class** for many families, especially dual‑earner households outside Tel Aviv’s most expensive areas.
- **> 25,000 NIS/month**
  – **Comfortable to affluent**; typically well above median living standards.

## 6. One‑Paragraph “Israel 2025” Snapshot

Around **2025**, **Israel** is a **high‑income, relatively fast‑growing economy** with a **nominal GDP of about \$611 billion**, **GDP per capita of about \$60,000**, and **PPP GDP per head in the high‑\$50k range**. A **typical salaried worker** (median) earns about **10,586 NIS/month** (~\$3,100), while the **average worker** earns about **15,098 NIS/month** (~\$4,400), reflecting a **43 % gap** between median and mean wages. The **national minimum wage** is **6,248 NIS/month**, roughly **60 % of the median**, and the **gender pay gap is very large**, with men earning **about 54 % more than women on average**. Despite **low unemployment (~3.1 %)** and **moderate inflation (~2.4 %)**, Israel has **one of the highest poverty rates in the OECD**, with **about 20.7 % of people and 27.9 % of children living in poverty**, and a **Gini coefficient around 0.345** signalling substantial inequality. In practice, a **dual‑earner middle‑class household** may enjoy a comfortable income, but **single‑earner and large families often hover close to or below the poverty threshold**, illustrating the tension between Israel’s strong macroeconomic performance and its **unevenly shared prosperity**.
