# Iraq around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Iraq “turn”**, aligned with the other country profiles you’ve collected.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Iraq (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage  

There is no single official published median, but combining national surveys and multiple wage studies gives a consistent picture:

- A reasonable **median‑type gross monthly wage** for a full‑time worker in 2025 is about  
  **≈ 500,000 IQD/month**.  

Using the 2025 average exchange rate (~**1 USD ≈ 1,310 IQD**):

- **500,000 IQD ≈ \$382/month**,  
- ≈ **\$4,600–4,700/year**.

Assuming ≈165 working hours per month:

- **Median gross hourly wage**  
  ≈ 500,000 ÷ 165 ≈ **3,030 IQD/hour** → **≈ \$2.30/hour**.

This is a good **“typical worker” benchmark**: many teachers, lower‑level public servants, and formal private‑sector staff cluster around this level.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

A detailed 2025 wage guide synthesizing Iraqi and international data reports:

- **Average gross monthly salary, 2025:** **675,000 IQD/month** ≈ **\$515/month** (≈ **\$6,200/year**) [1].  

Relative to the median‑type 500,000 IQD:

- The **mean is ≈ 35 % higher than the median**, signalling:
  - A sizeable **upper tail** (oil & gas, international NGOs, senior management),  
  - But not the extreme skew seen in some very unequal economies.

In round numbers for 2025:

- **Median‑type worker:** ≈ **500k IQD/month** (≈ \$380).  
- **Average worker:** ≈ **675k IQD/month** (≈ \$515).

### 1.3 Minimum wage  

Despite some confusing secondary sources, Iraq **does have a statutory national minimum wage** in its labour law:

- **Official minimum wage (2025):** **350,000 IQD/month** [2][3].  

Converted:

- 350,000 ÷ 1,310 ≈ **\$267/month**,  
- ≈ **\$3,200/year**.

Some sources also quote a lower historical floor (250,000 IQD) and a higher Kurdistan‑region floor (~450,000 IQD), but **350k IQD** is the current generally‑cited national minimum.

Relative to other benchmarks:

- **Minimum vs median‑type wage:** ~**70 %** (350k/500k).  
- **Minimum vs mean wage:** ~**52 %** (350k/675k).

So a full‑time minimum‑wage worker is **well below a typical worker** and close to, or below, many national poverty thresholds when supporting a large family.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

An ILO policy brief (Aug 2024) finds:

- **Women in Iraq earn 18.4 % less per hour than men**, on average [3].  

That is, women’s hourly pay is about:

- **81.6 % of men’s hourly pay**.

This gap shows up **across most sectors and regions**, and is compounded by very low female labour‑force participation (around 10–11 % vs 72 % for men).

### 1.5 Sector and regional wage differences  

From wage surveys, international hiring guides and Iraqi commentary:

- **Higher‑pay sectors**:
  - **Oil & gas, energy, senior engineering, finance, international NGOs**.  
    – Many mid‑level roles: **900,000–1,500,000 IQD/month** (≈ **\$690–1,150**).  
    – Senior expatriate or specialist roles can be far above this.

- **Mid‑range sectors**:
  - **Public‑sector professionals** (teachers, mid‑grade civil servants),  
  - **Skilled construction & manufacturing**,  
  - **Mid‑level office staff**.  
    – Roughly **400,000–800,000 IQD/month** (≈ **\$305–610**).

- **Low‑pay sectors**:
  - **Retail, hospitality, basic services, much of agriculture and informal work**.  
    – Typical range **250,000–400,000 IQD/month** (≈ **\$190–305**), close to the legal minimum.

**Regional pattern:**

- **Baghdad, major urban centres, Kurdistan Region** (Erbil, Sulaimani):  
  – Wages often **10–20 % above** the national median for similar jobs.  
- **Southern and rural governorates** (e.g., Thi‑Qar, Missan, rural Ninewa):  
  – Wages more often in the **250,000–450,000 IQD/month** band; informality is higher.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Average household and per‑person income  

The 2025 **Social and Economic Family Survey** (Ministry of Planning, with World Bank support) finds [4][5]:

- **Average monthly household income:** **1,188,000 IQD**.  
  – At 1,310 IQD/\$, ≈ **\$907/month** → **\$10,900/year**.  
- **Average monthly income per person:** **201,300 IQD**.  
  – ≈ **\$154/month** → **\$1,850/year**.

The 2025 census shows:

- **Average household size:** **5.7 persons** [6].  

Using those numbers:

\[
\text{Per‑person from household income} \approx \frac{1{,}188{,}000}{5.7} \approx 208{,}000\ \text{IQD/month} \approx \$159
\]

which is very close to the reported **201,300 IQD/month** per person, so the survey is internally consistent.

**Interpretation:**

- A “typical” Iraqi **household** lives on about **\$900–1,000 per month**, supporting **five to six people**.  
- A “typical person” has **cash income ≈ \$1,800–2,000 per year** – modest by upper‑middle‑income standards.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

Multiple sources (World Bank PIP, FRED, GlobalEconomy) converge on:

- **Gini index of disposable income (2023):** **29.8** on the 0–100 scale → **≈ 0.30** [8].  

Forecasts for 2025 keep it around **0.30**, with minor variation.

Implications:

- Iraq has **moderate income inequality**:
  - **More equal** than high‑inequality states like Brazil or South Africa,  
  - **Less equal** than the most egalitarian EU countries,  
  - But the Gini alone hides strong **regional and class divides**, especially between oil‑rich elites and poorer rural households.

Wealth data and recent analysis suggest:

- The **top 1 % earns about three times the combined income of the bottom 45 %** of the population [10], indicating **much sharper wealth and top‑income concentration** than the Gini suggests.

### 2.3 Poverty – income and multidimensional  

Key poverty perspectives:

1. **National poverty line**

   - Recent household surveys and UN reports indicate the **national income‑poverty rate** is around **17.5 % in 2023/24**, down from roughly **20 % in 2018** [9].  
   - Newer national statements (Ministry of Planning, 2025) and UN press notes claim a further drop to around **10.8 % by 2024** when measured with updated methodologies and broader coverage [9].  

   Directionally:  
   – **Poverty is falling**, but still **affects roughly 1 in 10–6 Iraqis**, depending on the exact measure and year.

2. **Multidimensional poverty (MPI)** – education, health, living standards combined

   OPHI’s harmonised **Global MPI 2024** (Iraq) reports [7]:

   - **8.6 % of Iraqis are multidimensionally poor (H)**.  
   - **Rural poverty rate:** 12.6 %; **urban:** 6.9 %.  
   - Some southern governorates (e.g., Missan, Basra, Thi‑Qar) exceed **13–17 %** multidimensional poverty.  
   - Severe poverty remains low in percentage terms (≈ 1–3 %), but concentrated geographically.

3. **Global extreme poverty lines**

   - World Bank PIP:  
     – **Poverty at \$3.00/day (2021 PPP):** **≈ 0.55 %** of the population.  
     – **At \$2.15/day:** ≈ **0.5 %** [9].  

   So **true extreme poverty is now rare**, but **vulnerability** remains high for low‑income rural and informal households.

### 2.4 Average vs median and “relative poverty”  

World Bank and Arab Development Portal data show:

- Around **8 % of the population lives below 50 % of median income**, a common **relative poverty** threshold [11].  

Given median‑type per‑person incomes (~\$1,800–2,000/year), this means:

- A sizeable group lives on **well under \$1,000/year per person**, particularly in regions with high unemployment and limited services, even if they are **not** counted as extreme poor in global \$‑per‑day terms.

## 3. Iraq’s GDP – Size, Growth and Per‑Capita Output

### 3.1 Nominal and PPP GDP per person  

IMF and Worldometer data for 2025 show [9][10]:

- **Nominal GDP, 2025:** ≈ **\$560–\$570 billion**.  
- **Population, mid‑2025:** **47,020,774** [9].  

Thus:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **\$5,832** [9].  

Wikipedia’s “Economy of Iraq” (IMF‑based) gives:

- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025 (est.):** **\$15,178** [10].  

So in simple terms:

> The Iraqi economy produces about **\$5,800 per person per year at market prices**, equivalent to about **\$15,000 per person per year in PPP terms** once lower domestic prices are taken into account.

### 3.2 Real growth  

IMF World Economic Outlook (Oct 2025) puts:

- **Real GDP growth, 2025:** **3.6 %** [11].  

Other forecasts (TradingEconomics, World Bank MPO) are in the **3.5–4.1 %** range, reflecting:

- Recovering oil output after OPEC+ cuts,  
- Modest growth in non‑oil sectors.

### 3.3 Inflation  

Inflation data from the Central Statistical Organization via TradingEconomics show [12]:

- **Annual inflation, October 2025:** **0.5 %**.  
- Monthly CPI changes from mid‑2025 have often been **negative** (deflation of ‑0.3 to ‑0.5 %).

Many commentaries describe this as a phase of **“price stability”** or mild **deflation**, supported by:

- A relatively **stable dinar** against the US dollar,  
- Weak domestic demand in some sectors.

### 3.4 Labour market  

ILO and macro‑forecast data compiled by TradingEconomics indicate [13][14]:

- **Overall unemployment rate (modeled ILO):**  
  – **15.5 % in 2024**,  
  – Forecast **≈ 15.0 % by end‑2025**.  

- **Youth unemployment (15–24), 2024:**  
  – **32.09 %** [14].  

This implies:

- **One in six adults** is unemployed,  
- **About one in three young people** is unemployed,  
- Under‑employment and informality are widespread, particularly for youth and in rural governorates.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key figures side‑by‑side (≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate level |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Nominal GDP per capita** | **\$5,832/year** |
| **PPP GDP per capita** | **\$15,178/year** |
| **Median‑type gross wage (individual)** | **≈ 500,000 IQD/month ≈ \$382/month ≈ \$4,600–4,700/year** |
| **Average gross wage (individual)** | **675,000 IQD/month ≈ \$515/month ≈ \$6,200/year** |
| **Official monthly minimum wage** | **350,000 IQD ≈ \$267/month** |
| **Average household income (5.7 persons)** | **1,188,000 IQD/month ≈ \$907/month ≈ \$10,900/year** |
| **Average per‑person income** | **201,300 IQD/month ≈ \$154/month ≈ \$1,850/year** |
| **Gini coefficient (income)** | **≈ 0.30** |
| **Multidimensional poverty headcount** | **8.6 %** |
| **Income poverty (national line)** | **≈ 10.8–17.5 %**, depending on survey & year |
| **Unemployment** | **≈ 15 % overall; ≈ 32 % youth** |
| **Inflation (CPI)** | **≈ 0.5 % (near zero)** |
| **Real GDP growth** | **≈ 3.6 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps  

1. **GDP per head vs people’s incomes**  
   - Even though **GDP per person ≈ \$5,800 nominal**, the **average person’s cash income** is only **≈ \$1,850/year** [4][5].  
   - The difference arises because a substantial share of GDP is:
     - **Oil profits and corporate earnings**,  
     - **Government consumption and investment**,  
     - **Depreciation and net external balances**,  
     rather than directly entering household budgets.

2. **Wages vs household incomes**  
   - A **typical wage earner** (500k IQD/month ≈ \$382) bringing home maybe **\$300–340 net** cannot, on their own, support an average‑size family of 5–6 at the **average household income level** (~\$907/month).  
   - Many households therefore rely on:
     - **Multiple earners** (e.g., two adults working in the formal or informal sector),  
     - **Public transfers, pensions, and remittances**,  
     - **Self‑employment and agricultural output** that are only partly captured in wage statistics.

3. **Inequality & poverty**  
   - A **Gini of ≈0.30** suggests **moderate inequality**, but:
     - Around **8–10 %** of Iraqis still live in **multidimensional or income poverty**,  
     - Southern and rural regions have much higher deprivation rates,  
     - The **top 1 %** enjoys incomes several times higher than the bottom half, especially in oil‑linked sectors.  

4. **Labour market stress**  
   - Even with **3.6 % real GDP growth** and near‑zero inflation, **15 % unemployment** and **32 % youth unemployment** mean:
     - Many young people never reach the “median worker” wage,  
     - **Labour‑market mismatch** and slow private‑sector diversification constrain household incomes.

## 5. Practical Income Benchmarks (Iraq, ≈2025)

### 5.1 Individual gross monthly income (IQD)  

- **< 250,000 IQD/month (≲ \$190)**  
  – Very low income, often **informal or part‑time**; difficult to support dependants.

- **250,000–500,000 IQD/month (≈ \$190–382)**  
  – **Lower‑middle range**; close to minimum‑to‑median; common for junior clerical work, small retail and agriculture.

- **500,000–800,000 IQD/month (≈ \$382–610)**  
  – **Broad middle**: typical for many full‑time workers in the civil service, education, and mid‑range private jobs.

- **800,000–1,500,000 IQD/month (≈ \$610–1,150)**  
  – **Upper‑middle**: engineers, oil‑field technicians, senior admins, many managers, especially in Baghdad and Kurdistan.

- **> 1,500,000 IQD/month (≥ \$1,150)**  
  – **High income** nationally; senior management, top‑end professionals, lucrative oil & gas or international positions.

### 5.2 Household net monthly income (≈5–6 persons)  

- **< 700,000 IQD/month (≲ \$535)**  
  – Often **below or near the national poverty line**, especially with children; high vulnerability to shocks.

- **700,000–1,200,000 IQD/month (≈ \$535–920)**  
  – **Low‑ to lower‑middle‑income**: basics can be covered in cheaper regions, but budgets are tight.

- **1,200,000–2,000,000 IQD/month (≈ \$920–1,530)**  
  – **Core middle class**: roughly the range containing the average household (1.188m IQD); comfortable if housing costs are moderate.

- **> 2,000,000 IQD/month (≥ \$1,530)**  
  – **Comfortable to affluent**: able to save, invest and weather shocks; often includes higher‑earning dual‑earner households.

## 6. Short “Iraq 2025” Snapshot  

By **2025**, **Iraq** is an **oil‑rich, upper‑middle‑income economy** with **nominal GDP per person around \$5,800** and **PPP GDP per head near \$15,200**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns roughly **500,000 IQD/month (\$380)**, while the **average wage** is higher at **675,000 IQD/month (\$515)**, and the **national minimum wage** is **350,000 IQD/month (\$267)**. A **typical household of about 5.7 people** lives on **≈1.19 million IQD/month (\$900–1,000)**, meaning **per‑person cash income averages only about \$1,850/year**. Income inequality is **moderate (Gini ≈ 0.30)**, and **extreme poverty is rare**, but **8–10 % of Iraqis are still multidimensionally or income‑poor**, with higher deprivation in rural and southern governorates. Macroeconomically, Iraq enjoys **solid real GDP growth (~3.6 %)** and **near‑zero inflation (~0.5 %)**, yet **unemployment remains high (~15 % overall, ~32 % among youth)** and many jobs are informal or low‑paid. The result is an economy where **headline GDP and oil‑sector revenues look strong**, but **typical households experience modest and uneven living standards**, heavily shaped by geography, sector of employment, and household size.
