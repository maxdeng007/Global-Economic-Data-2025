# Greece around 2025 – Salaries, Incomes, GDP and GDP per Person  

This is the **Greece “turn”**, aligned with the structure of your other country profiles.

---

## 1. Salary Levels in Greece (2024–2025)

### 1.1 Typical (median‑type) wage  

A Eurostat‑based 2025 analysis of Greek wages reports for **2024**:

- **Median gross annual wage (full‑time, Greece):** **€17,954**  
  – Up from **€17,070** in 2023 (+5 %) [1].  

This corresponds to:

- **Median gross monthly wage:**  
  \[
  17{,}954 / 12 \approx \textbf{€1,496 / month}
  \]

Using a typical ~165‑hour working month:

- **Median gross hourly wage:**  
  \[
  1{,}496 / 165 \approx \textbf{€9.1 / hour}
  \]

In rough USD terms (2025, ≈1 € ≈ 1.13 US\$):

- **≈ US\$1,700 / month**,  
- **≈ US\$20,000 / year**.

This is a good **“typical full‑time worker”** benchmark for Greece around 2025.

### 1.2 Average (mean) wages  

A 2025 salary overview based on EFKA (social‑security) data and private surveys finds:

- **Average gross monthly salary (2024–2025, private sector):** **€1,150–€1,300** [2].  
- A late‑2025 news report using official data notes **private‑sector salaries in May 2025 averaged about €1,369 / month** (gross).  

So, depending on the exact coverage:

> **Average gross monthly wage (all employees):** ≈ **€1,250–1,350 / month**  
> → **€15,000–16,000 / year**  
> → **US\$17,000–18,000 / year**.

The **mean is only moderately above the median** (~5–15 %), indicating that while Greece has high earners, **wage dispersion is less extreme than in very unequal economies**.

### 1.3 Minimum wage  

Greece has a **statutory minimum wage** for full‑time employees that has been raised several times since 2022:

- **From 1 April 2025:** **€880 / month gross** (14‑month reference) [3][4].  
- **By late 2025 (Q4 2025):** minimum reaches **€1,027 / month gross** at 12‑month equivalence according to Eurostat/TradingEconomics [5], confirmed by Eurostat’s minimum‑wage comparison (Greece: **€1,027**; Portugal: €1,015 etc.) [6].

Key ratios:

- **Minimum vs median wage:**  
  – **€1,027 / €1,496 ≈ 69 %**.  
- **Minimum vs average private‑sector wage (~€1,300):**  
  – **€1,027 / €1,300 ≈ 79 %**.

So a full‑time worker on the statutory minimum is **only about 20–30 % below the median wage**, a relatively **compressed bottom end** by international standards.

### 1.4 Gender pay gap  

Recent EU and Greek commentary on the gender wage gap show:

- **Unadjusted gender pay gap (Greece):** **≈ 10.4 %** – women earn about **89.6 % of men’s average hourly pay** [7][8].  
- **Adjusted gap** (controlling for occupation, age, education) is lower, around **6 %**, according to pay‑gap and EU‑directive briefings [7].

In practice:

> Women’s wages are **≈ 10 % lower than men’s on average**, and **≈ 6 % lower** once job‑mix differences are controlled for.

### 1.5 Sector and regional differences  

**Sector examples (gross monthly ranges)**  

From Paylab, SalaryExpert and national reporting:

- **IT & digital (Paylab Greece)** [9]:  
  – Overall IT category: **€1,547–4,163 / month** for 80 % of workers;  
  – Lead developers, IT architects: up to **€8,800 / month**.  

- **Finance & business roles**:  
  – Financial associates: **≈ €45,800 / year** → **≈ €3,800 / month** [10].  
  – Financial managers: typical ranges **€4,500–6,000+ / month** (various 2025 guides).

- **Healthcare**:  
  – Doctor of Medicine average base salary: **€84,658 / year** → **≈ €7,050 / month** [11].  
  – Family doctors in Athens: **≈ €103,000 / year** → **≈ €8,600 / month** (upper tier specialist roles) [11].

- **Teachers & education** (Mobiletator 2025) [2]:  
  – **School teacher (2–3 years’ experience, net):** **€900–1,300 / month**.  
  – University professors (Eurydice): **entry basic gross** ≈ **€2,100+ / month** for full professors.

- **Hospitality, retail, basic services** (Mobiletator 2025) [2]:  
  – Waiter in a good Athens restaurant (incl. tips): **€750–1,100 / month net**.  
  – Hotel housekeeper: **€650–850 / month net**.

**Regional differences**

- **Athens & Thessaloniki**: Salaries in mid‑ to high‑skill professions often **5–10 % above** the national average.  
- **Smaller cities and rural regions**: Wages comparatively lower (10–15 %), but with somewhat **lower living costs**, especially in housing.

## 2. Household Income, Inequality and Poverty

### 2.1 Household income – per person and per household  

Two sources are key:

1. **Median equivalent disposable income per person**  

   A 2025 analysis of Greece’s middle class reports:

   - **Median equivalent disposable income (2024):** **≈ €11,000–12,000 / year per person** [2][12].  
     → **≈ €920–1,000 / month per person**.

   This is EUROSTAT‑consistent, and closely matches ELSTAT’s own median (which implies a **60 % line ~€6,510**; see §2.3).

2. **Aggregate household disposable income**  

   ELSTAT and press coverage report:

   - **Total disposable income of households and NPISH, 2024:** **€158.6 billion**, up 4.5 % from €151.7 billion in 2023 [13].  
   - Using ~**4.07 million households** in 2024 [14]:  
     \[
     158.6\text{ bn} / 4.073\text{ m} \approx \textbf{€38,900 / household / year}
     \]  
     → **≈ €3,240 / month per household (average)**.

With an **average household size ~2.6 persons** (Eurostat 2024) [15]:

- **Average per‑capita household income:**  
  – ≈ €38,900 / 2.6 ≈ **€14,960 / year** → **€1,247 / month**.  
- **Median per‑capita income** is lower at **€11–12k/year**, reflecting **mean > median**.

So, ballpark:

> - **Median per‑person disposable income:** **€11–12k/year** → **€920–1,000/month**.  
> - **Median household (≈2.6 people):** **≈ €2,400–2,600/month**.  
> - **Average household:** **≈ €3,200–3,300/month**.

### 2.2 Inequality – Gini coefficient  

ELSTAT’s 2024 income‑distribution report states:

- **Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income (2024):** **31.8 %** [16].  

On the 0–1 scale: **Gini ≈ 0.318**.

Context:

- **Slightly above** the most egalitarian EU countries (which sit around 0.25–0.28),  
- **Very close** to the EU average (~0.30–0.32),  
- **Much more equal** than high‑inequality emerging markets.

### 2.3 Poverty – thresholds and incidence  

ELSTAT’s **RISK OF POVERTY OR SOCIAL EXCLUSION** bulletin (2024 SILC, income year 2023) provides:

- **Median equivalised disposable income:** **€10,850 / year** [16].  
- **Poverty threshold (60 % of median)**:

  | Household type | Annual threshold | Monthly |
  |----------------|------------------|---------|
  | **Single person** | **€6,510** | **≈ €542** |
  | **Two adults** | **€9,765** | **≈ €814** |
  | **Two adults + 2 children <14** | **€13,671** | **≈ €1,140** |

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate (after social transfers, 2024):** **19.6 % of population** (~1 in 5 people) [1][16].  

Eurostat data also show:

- **At‑risk‑of‑poverty or social exclusion (AROPE):** **≈ low‑20s %** (Greece sits among the **five poorest** EU members on this metric in 2025 press coverage).  

In practical terms:

> A **single adult** below **~€550/month** and a **family of four** below **~€1,140/month** are **officially poor**; around **20 % of Greeks** live below these relative thresholds even after social transfers.

## 3. Greece’s GDP – Size, Per‑Capita Levels, Growth and Inflation

### 3.1 Nominal GDP and GDP per person  

IMF’s WEO DataMapper and Eurostat give for **2025**:

- **Nominal GDP per capita, 2025:** **\$29.41k** (US\$) [17].  
- **PPP GDP per capita, 2025 (est.):** **\$44.99k** [18].  

Using **population ≈ 10.37 million** (ELSTAT, 1 Jan 2025) [19]:

- **Total nominal GDP:**  
  – ≈ \$29,412 × 10.37m ≈ **\$305 billion**.

Worldometers (based on IMF) gives a slightly lower nominal per‑capita figure:

- **\$27,170 per person (2025)** [20]; we’ll prioritise the direct IMF figure **\$29.41k**.

In any case:

> Greece is a **high‑income economy** by global standards, with **nominal GDP/head ≈ \$27–29k** and **PPP output/head ≈ \$45k**.

### 3.2 Real GDP growth  

The **IMF** and the **European Commission 2025 forecast** both show:

- **Real GDP growth 2024:** **≈ 2.3 %**.  
- **Real GDP growth 2025 (forecast & early estimates):** **≈ 2.0–2.1 %** [21].  

So Greece is growing at a **moderate but positive pace**, slightly above many euro‑area peers but below some central‑/eastern‑European economies.

### 3.3 Inflation  

Inflation data from **ELSTAT** and **TradingEconomics**:

- **Annual CPI inflation, December 2025:** **+2.6 % YoY** [22].  
- Monthly CPI in 2025 fluctuated between about **2.4–2.7 % YoY**.

Other sources (e.g., ECB, Bank of Greece) put **average 2025 inflation around 3.0–3.1 %**, but the **end‑year reading is 2.6 %**, indicating **gradual disinflation back towards 2 %**.

### 3.4 Labour market – unemployment  

ELSTAT’s labour‑force survey and Eurostat‑based aggregations show:

- **Seasonally‑adjusted unemployment rate (May 2025):** **7.9 %** [23].  
- **September–November 2025 values:** **≈ 8.2–8.6 %**, with **October 2025 at 8.6 %** [24].  
- The Commission notes **October 2025 unemployment (Eurostat)** at **8.2 %**, the **lowest since 2009**, yet still well above the EU average [21].  

Youth unemployment:

- **Under‑25 unemployment:** **≈ 21.6 %**, based on 2025 country‑economy/Eurostat figures.

So:

> The labour market is **much healthier than during the debt‑crisis years**, but **headline unemployment around 8–9 %** and **youth unemployment above 20 %** remain substantial challenges.

## 4. How GDP, Wages and Incomes Relate

### 4.1 Key indicators side‑by‑side (Greece ≈2025)

| Metric | Approximate value |
|--------|-------------------|
| **GDP per capita (nominal)** | **\$27–29k / person / year** |
| **GDP per capita (PPP)** | **≈ \$45k / person / year** |
| **Median gross wage (individual)** | **€1,496 / month ≈ €18k / year** |
| **Average gross wage (individual)** | **€1,250–1,350 / month ≈ €15–16k / year** |
| **Statutory minimum wage (late‑2025)** | **€1,027 / month (gross)** |
| **Median per‑person disposable income** | **€11–12k / year ≈ €920–1,000 / month** |
| **Average household disposable income** | **≈ €38.9k / year ≈ €3,240 / month** |
| **Average household size** | **≈ 2.6 persons** |
| **Gini coefficient (disposable income)** | **0.318** |
| **At‑risk‑of‑poverty rate** | **19.6 % of population** |
| **Unemployment rate** | **≈ 8–9 %** |
| **Youth unemployment (<25)** | **≈ 21–22 %** |
| **Inflation (CPI, Dec 2025)** | **2.6 % YoY** |
| **Real GDP growth (2025)** | **≈ 2.0–2.1 %** |

### 4.2 Interpreting the gaps  

1. **GDP per head vs typical wage earner**  
   - **Nominal GDP/head (~\$28–29k)** is **~1.5 times** the **median gross wage (~€18k ≈ \$20k)**.  
   - This is expected: GDP must cover **wages + profits + taxes + depreciation**, and is divided by **everyone** (children, retirees, non‑workers), not just full‑time employees.

2. **Wages vs household disposable income**  
   - A **single median worker** on **€1,500/month gross** (perhaps **€1,100–1,200 net**) supporting a household alone would be **not far above** the poverty line for a multi‑person family.  
   - The **average household disposable income (~€3,240/month)** implies **most middle‑class households have two earners**, a mix of wages, pensions, and self‑employment, or both.

3. **Median vs average income**  
   - **Average household income (~€38.9k/year)** is **well above** the income implied by the **median per‑person figure (~€11–12k)** times average household size, showing that **top‑decile households pull the average up**.  
   - For “how a typical person lives”, the **median (~€11–12k)** is more informative than the mean.

4. **Inequality and poverty overlay**  
   - With a **Gini of ~0.318** and **19.6 % at risk of poverty**, Greece is:  
     - **More equal** than many non‑EU countries,  
     - Yet still has **roughly one in five people with very low incomes** by EU standards.  
   - Large shares of the population (especially **young adults, single‑parent households, and some rural regions**) live **close to the 60 %‑of‑median line**.

5. **Macro vs micro picture**  
   - Macroeconomically, Greece has **solid per‑capita GDP** and **2 % real growth** with **moderate inflation**.  
   - But relatively **low median wages**, **high youth unemployment**, and **persistent relative poverty** mean the **average Greek household’s experience is much tighter** than headline GDP figures suggest.

## 5. Practical Benchmarks (Greece 2025)

### 5.1 Individual worker – gross monthly income (EUR)

Approximate positioning in the national distribution:

- **< €1,000 / month**  
  → Typically **low‑paid or part‑time** roles (many hospitality, retail, informal jobs). Difficult to live independently in major cities.

- **€1,000–€1,500 / month**  
  → **Lower‑middle range**, around **minimum‑to‑median**; common for junior office staff, teachers, basic technicians, many service‑sector workers.

- **€1,500–€2,500 / month**  
  → **Core middle tier**; typical of mid‑career office workers, experienced teachers, mid‑level public servants, many skilled trades.

- **€2,500–€4,000 / month**  
  → **Upper‑middle**; many IT professionals, finance roles, senior engineers, doctors in public hospitals (base wage), mid‑ to high‑level managers.

- **> €4,000 / month**  
  → **High income** nationally; senior managers, top specialists, successful entrepreneurs, highly paid IT/finance roles.

### 5.2 Household – net monthly income (2–3 people)

Using the **EU 60 %‑of‑median thresholds**:

- **< €1,500 / month**  
  → For a 2‑person household, often **at or below the poverty line** (\< €814/month for 2 adults; \< €1,140 for 2 adults + 2 kids).  
  → Vulnerable to housing, energy and food‑price shocks.

- **€1,500–€2,500 / month**  
  → **Lower‑middle**; basics covered but little room for savings or major expenses. Many single‑earner households with children fall here.

- **€2,500–€4,000 / month**  
  → **Broad middle class**; comfortable in most of the country, can manage rent/mortgage, utilities, some savings and discretionary spending.

- **> €4,000 / month**  
  → **Upper‑middle to affluent**; strong financial security, especially outside the most expensive parts of Athens.

## 6. Short “Greece 2025” Snapshot  

Around **2025**, **Greece** is a **moderately unequal, high‑income EU economy** with **nominal GDP per capita around \$27–29k** and **PPP GDP per head near \$45k**. A **typical full‑time worker** earns about **€1,500/month gross** (median), while **average wages** are only slightly lower at **€1,250–1,350/month**, and the **statutory minimum wage** has risen to **€1,027/month**, roughly **70 % of the median**. Median **disposable income per person** is about **€11–12k/year**, yielding **typical household incomes of roughly €2,400–2,600/month net**, though the **average household** earns closer to **€3,200/month** due to an upper‑income tail. With a **Gini of about 0.318** and **19.6 % of people at risk of poverty**, Greece combines **EU‑typical inequality** with **above‑average poverty**, especially among youth and vulnerable regions. Macroeconomic conditions are **stable** – **real GDP growth around 2 %**, **inflation ~2.6 %**, and **unemployment ~8–9 %** – but **high youth joblessness and modest median wages** mean that for many households, **everyday living standards lag well behind the country’s aggregate GDP performance**.
